<p>The functionality I desire is to have two images in a table, side by side. When a user hovers over one of the images, a drop-down menu appears with a few different links. When the user moves their mouse off of the image, the menu will disappear. </p>

<p>This is my HTML for the Content Editor Web Part containing the images:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table _moz_resizing=""true""&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These two images are side by side. Now, I would like to incorporate the effect I made note of above as seen at this link:

<p>(Only the mouseover effect and essentially for only one ""header"" (the image) as I will only have three sub-menu links. )</p>

<p>I never really learned javascript, but merely look resources I found online and incorporate them onto pages. Can someone please outline how I would structure the HTML and Jquery with the appropriate DIV tags to get this working? Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>When I run the program in debug mode I recieve the following error message (I tried to translate it as accurately as possible):</p>

<p><em>Windows has triggered a breakpoint in LogoColorDetector.exe. This can be caused by heap corruption which indicates a problem in LogoColorDetector.exe or one of its loaded DLLs[...]</em></p>

<p>When I debug the program I found that the problem seems to occur in the following line:</p>

<pre><code>std::string tmp = imgTrain2[j]-&gt;getFilepath();

<p>The getFilepath()-Function is implemented as follows:</p>

<pre><code>const std::string&amp; support::Image::getFilepath() const
{
    return this-&gt;_filePath;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have already checked if the Image-object at imgTrain[j] has a correct _filePath string. So I assume the problem is somewhere else. The funny thing is, that the function that contains the problematic line seems to work. It's only the second time I call the function where it fails which would indicate that the problem is not in the function itself. I don't allocate any memory nor do i delete anything in the function except what is maybe done indirectly through std::string</p>

<p>Tried the suggestion with Visual Leak Detector. It doesn't show anything until the moment the above mentioned error message pops up and says that memory was modified after it has been freed. Is there a way to find out what object was associated with the memory address - the memory dump doesn't seem to be very helpful.</p>

<p>Here is the code I am trying to get working</p>

<pre><code>(function() {

var img = document.getElementById('maincontent').firstChild;
img.onload = function() {
if(img.width &gt; img.height) {
    img.width = '100%';
    img.height = 'auto';
}
};
}());
</code></pre>

<p>So I am grabing the img which is the child of the div maincontent then changing it's width and height values if needed. But it just doesn't seem to activate.</p>

<p>I have this other piece of code which does work fine and I added the width and height change to the end of the code and it still doesn't work. When I add the border part to it it does add the border so I know the code should work.</p>

<pre><code>$('#thumbs img').click(function(){ 
 /* On a thumbnail click */
var src = $(this).attr(""src"").match(/[^\.]+/) + ""large.jpg"";
$('#maincontent img').attr(""src"", src);
$('#thumbs img').removeClass('inact').addClass('act');
$(this).removeClass('act').addClass('inact');
$('#maincontent img').width = '100%';
$('#maincontent img').height = 'auto';
$('#maincontent img').attr('border', '10px');

});
});
</code></pre>

<p>So changing the src of the image works,
so does the attribute of the border but the width and height doesn't change. Anyone know why? If people need more to work with let me know.</p>

<p>Normally I log into putty to a linux server, from there I ssh into another company server and I navigate through directories and perform my operations mainly as <code>cat</code>, <code>zcat</code> etc., with grep filters. Ex:</p>

<ol>
<li>login to example_server with putty</li>
<li>ssh to ssh_server</li>
<li>cd to req dir</li>
<li>perform cat etc.,</li>
</ol>

<p>ssh_server will not directly allow to be logged in from putty, I have to first login to example_server and then to ssh_server.</p>

<p>How can I configure these log files to be used by splunk to search for a string, similarly to how I use grep. I've installed splunk on my laptop, and by clicking <code>add data &gt; files</code> and <code>dir &gt; add new</code> it shows full path to the data field, what path should I fill it with?</p>

<pre><code> 1) I can't do any modification to server(have no rights), so i couldn't use splunk    universal forwarder
 2)There's no way i can open port to write to and make splunk listen to it, as i said              my higher-ups won't allow, if something goes wrong, it will cost my job
 if there's anyway i can write to port securely ,that might help.
 3) I can run shell scripts FYI
 4)It will help if anyone suggest how i can securely connect to log servers, download data files(not manually) a python script or .bat file, and will use this local directory in splunk :)

"349775","FullCalendar displaying last weeks events below this weeks events","<p>I am developing an application to manage an On-Call calendar, using FullCalendar to render it.  Most events are 1 week long, starting at 8:00 AM Tuesday and ending the following Tuesday at 8:00 AM.  Another event, presumably with a different person on-call, will follow that event.</p>

<p>During a hallway usability test, someone commented that the month calendar view was difficult to read because the previous weeks event is not at the top of the stack, instead rendering below the event that starts during that week.  When being viewed, the eye perceives that it should go down 1 line to view the remaining timeline because the event from last week is there, instead of moving down to the following week.</p>

<p>I investigated what I believe to be the problem:  </p>

<pre><code>function segCmp(a, b) {  
    return (b.msLength - a.msLength) * 100 + (a.event.start - b.event.start);  
}</code></pre>

<p>sorts the events for a row, but uses the length of the event in the calculation.  Since the current week's event will have a longer duration, it always get sorted to the top.  To test, I changed the start dates to Wednesday so the durations are closer.  This cause the events to render how I would expect, with last weeks events at the top and this weeks at the bottom.</p>

<p>I thought that if one of the events in the compare doesn't start that week, then it should only be compared based on the start times.  I modified the function to be:  </p>

<pre><code>function segCmp(a, b) {
    if (a.isStart == false || b.isStart == false) {
        return (a.event.start - b.event.start);
    }
    return (b.msLength - a.msLength) * 100 + (a.event.start - b.event.start);
}</code></pre>

<p>This solved my problem, and the rendering now looks good - and passes the hallway test.  What I don't know is if this would have an impact in other areas.  I have taken a look at the other views (month, week, day) and they all seem to be rendering properly as well.  I am just not familiar with FullCalendar enough to file a bug or feature request on this, or if this would even be considered a bug.</p>

<p>I am wondering if what I modified is correct, or if it is not what a better modification would be to fix this issue.</p>

<p>I tried browsing the Apache2 and mod_proxy docs but found nothing useful.
Any idea why Apache2 refuses to proxy requests bigger than X bytes ?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Now I'm looking for a way to invalidate this cache when necessary, which means I need to to know when a Page is published</strong> (including immediately after creation) <strong>or unpublished</strong> (including as a result of deletion), since this will invalidate the cached query result.</p>

<p>I've looked into the available mechanisms for determining when this happens, but what I've found so far doesn't quite seem to cut it:</p>

<p><code>SPFormContext.OnSaveHandler</code> - this seems specific to the Save button in the ribbon and wouldn't let me trap a Publish from, say, Manage Content and Structure. Right?</p>

<p><code>SPItemEventReceiver.ItemUpdated</code> - this doesn't seem to receive notifications for Publish and Unpublish. Right?</p>

<p>Is there a way to subscribe to the kind of ""OnPublish"" and ""OnUnpublish"" events I'm looking for? Or is there a different solution altogether?</p>

"349788","How to save multiple partial views on a submit","<p>Basically I've got a view that has a drop down list, then based on the selection of that list, another partial view is returned from the controller, then inside each of those partial views is another drop down list that connects to the controller to return another partial view... I want to be able to save all of these at once... what's my best option?</p>

<p>Here's the code in the root view:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.LabelFor(m =&gt; m.DonationType.DonationTypex) &lt;br /&gt;
        @Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.DonationType.DonationTypeID, ViewBag.DonationTypes as

})

&lt;div id=""donationSection""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then JQuery at the bottom:</p>

<pre><code> $(""#btnContinue"").click(function () {
        var donationTypeID = $(this).closest('p').find('#selectList').val();
        var id = parseInt(donationTypeID);

        return false;
    });

"349797","Why does it suddenly cause an exception to load a dictionary from a LSO object in flash AS3?","<p>Ran into this strange bug developing a web game in Flash CS5.5 </p>

<p>When the game starts up it loads player history information from the LSO.  I've been doing it the same way for months now, but for some reason about 10 days ago the following line and other similar ones starting causing exceptions in Chrome and Internet Explorer.  They all have to do with loading a dictionary from an LSO data object.  Does anyone know why this would suddenly start to cause problems now, when it worked fine before?  Since my code and compile setup has been the same for a long time, is it possible that something changed in Chrome or Internet Explorer?  </p>

<p>during startup the LSO gets loaded</p>

<pre><code>this.lso = SharedObject.getLocal(""myLSO"");
</code></pre>

<p>but then this exception happens:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>User exception thrown: TypeError: Error #1034: Type Coercion failed:
  cannot convert Object@1278ad19 to flash.utils.Dictionary...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which was being caused by this line:</p>

<pre><code>this.game.playerHist.completionData=this.lso.data.playerHistory.completionData;
</code></pre>

<p>the solution that finally worked was to clone the dictionary like this:</p>

<pre><code>this.game.playerHist.completionData =
    this.clone(this.lso.data.playerHistory.completionData);
</code></pre>

<p>using this function, which essentially does the same thing in treating the original object like a dictionary (by getting its keys), but for some reason is doesn't raise an exception:</p>

<pre><code>function clone(original:Object):Dictionary {
    var cloned:Dictionary= new Dictionary();
    for(var key:Object in original) {
        cloned[key]=original[key];
    }
    return cloned;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also strangely sometimes when a dictionary was loaded without the clone function it worked fine in IE and only raised an exception in Chrome.  Does anyone have any ideas what might be the difference between the 2 browsers, or have any way to explain this?</p>

"349806","Removing access denied error on attempting to open certain filetypes","<p>I've been given a machine with Win XP already on it that has an interesting security feature enabled. Any file called ""autorun.inf"" cannot be accessed by the user, windows just throws up ""Access denied"" error instead. I can't even rename files with that name, the only action that succeeds is delete.</p>

<p>I thought this might be due to Symantec Endpoint Protection which had been installed on the machine, however after removing this with CleanWipe I still get the same access denied message.</p>

"349812","Resetting file/folder permissions when migrating from Win2k to Win2008","<p>I first want to say well done for all the info on this site but I've got a high-level question regarding folder/file permissions that I'm looking to solve in one of the following two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using ICALCS to reset permissions. </li>
<li>ASP.net c# web form using builtin FileSecurity api.</li>
</ol>

<p>You see I'm currently moving all Win2k server webapps to a Win2008 server. The problem is that since were making such a big jump from 2k to 2008, the conversion tools for the migration do not work. That being said, my task is to copy all websites (currently all in one dir) from 2k to 2008 server, somehow save all permissions from 2k and reapply those permissions in 2008. I see that from above the steps are in place to reset the permissions but is there a recommendation as to how I save the permissions from Win2k and then reapply them to the copied files on 2008? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

"349813","hint with Bayes rule problem","<p>The pirate Captain Queequeg has a lazy crew and suspects they are planning to stage a mutiny. Captain Queequeg's solution is to have every member of the crew roll Queequeg's lucky die. If the roll is even, the crew member must walk the plank. If the roll is odd, the crew member must take a swig of truth serum and then reveal his or her true intent. If the crew member was planning on mutiny, he or she must walk the plank, and if not, is allowed to remain on the ship. Queequeg's die has been cursed so that evens are rolled 61% of the time. Crew members are either lazy or mutinous but not both. Of the crew members who take the serum, 18% are forced to reveal they were planning mutiny.</p>

<p>1) What is the chance a crew member will walk the plank, given he or she is mutinous?</p>

<p>2) What is the chance a crew member will walk the plank, given he or she is just plain lazy (but not mutinous)?</p>

<p>3) What is the chance a crew member is mutinous, given he or she walked the plank?</p>

<p>This is what I have so far:</p>

<p>The probability of walking the plank seems to be </p>

<p>$P(\text{plank}) = P(\text{mutinous} \cap \text{odd})+P(\text{lazy} \cap \text{even})$</p>

<p>$P(\text{plank}) = P(\text{mutinous})P(\text{odd})+P(\text{lazy})P(\text{even})$ Rolling the die is independent of being mutinous or lazy.</p>

<p>$P(\text{lazy})= P(\lnot \text{mutinous})$</p>

<p>1) I tried applying Bayes rule, but then I need the posterior probability from part 3) first.</p>

<p>$$P(\text{plank} \mid \text{mutinous}) = {P(\text{mutinous} \mid \text{plank})P(\text{plank}) \over P(mutinous)}$$</p>

<p>Expanding the likelihood using total probability</p>

<p>$$P(\text{plank} \mid \text{mutinous}) = {P(\text{mutinous} \mid \text{plank})P(\text{plank}) \over P(\text{mutinous} \mid \text{plank})P(\text{plank}) + P(\text{mutinous} \mid \lnot \text{plank})P(\lnot \text{plank})}$$</p>

<p>Using conditional probability, substituting the joint probability for the posterior and prior</p>

<p>$$P(\text{plank}\mid\text{mutinous}) = {P(\text{mutinous} \cap \text{plank}) \over P(\text{mutinous}\mid\text{plank})P(\text{plank}) + P(\text{mutinous}\mid\lnot\text{plank})P(\lnot\text{plank})}$$</p>

<p>Being mutinous and walking the plank aren't independent events, so I am not sure where to go from here.</p>

I tried implementig it with the OnClick property (which is how I implement all other buttons that go <em>forward</em>), but it causes total overlapping between all the divs..

<p>There is some things I want to add and some I want to remove from the object before returning it, so simply doing one of these:</p>

<pre><code>respond_to do |format|
  format.json {
    render :json =&gt; @object.to_json
  }
end
</code></pre>

<p>Won't necessarily work. I don't want everything in that object exposed. I was thinking I had two opeions here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a private helper method in the controller that builds a new object with only what I want in it, and send that along instead. The problem here is that I have a few views helper methods that I woudn't be able to use with this approach.</li>
<li>Write out the json manually in a show.json.erb view. Problem here is it seems like I'm going against the grain and have to put in lots of logic to account for trailing commas and whatnot.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this were HTML that I was returning instead, I would obviously just use a .html.erb file and only include what I want in there. But since I'm dealing with JSON, it seems like I should handle almost everything in code and not even deal with a views file.</p>

System doesn't boot into Windows and on booting just poped up a Window of Restoration of system launching. So I let it find and fix errors but even after 16 hours it didn't complete scan.</p>

<p>I tried R-studio for file recovery and I found that main partition is full of CRC32 errors.
I deleted the partition and restored the system from factory recovery. Recovery lasted for 4 hours and even after that was not without problem.</p>

<p>Restored system was so slow. So I formated system and installed fresh system from CD. What was a surprise when installation of Windows 7 lasted for 1 hour and then the next 1 hour for setting system up (time, acc name etc) and even more with 2 hours of installing drivers and AV.</p>

<p>I then looked at the web and found Superuser and hope that someone has had a similar problem. His or her problem was solved by updating the BIOS, so I tried it. Nothing happend for better and I even tried testinig the memory with memtest+ and other test utilities on Hirens boot cd.</p>

<p>So, has anyone else experienced this issue? I was running ads purely through XML before, now, I need more ad control so I must request the ads programmatically. XML works fine, programmatically fails on its face hard.</p>

<p>Attaching code is not going to help much, basically, in onCreate I findViewById the AdView XML  and then simply do a AdRequest() on this. Nothing fancy, should work according to the documentation (which I fear is not up to date).</p>

<ul>

<li>id 2>&amp;1;whoami 2>&amp;1;</li>
<li>id 2>&amp;1</li>

<li>echo 1</li>
</ul>

<p>The server is running linux (of some kind, not sure what..) and there is no SSH access. I'm not 100% sure it's x-cart that's issued these commands, although looking through the setup script I can see there are a few commands that may explain a few of these in xcheck.php:</p>

<pre><code>@exec( ""echo 1"", $o, $e);

@exec( $this-&gt;test."" 2&gt;&amp;1"", $this-&gt;data, $code);

<p>However, I grepped the entire source of the shop dir (and a couple of other x-cart files) for 'whoami' and 'id', and could not find anything.</p>

<p>The host (and the person I'm working for) need to be fairly sure it's not been compromised.</p>

<p>I traced the code back as far as I could, but couldn't find anything really that implies running whoami and id.</p>

<p>I'm 80% sure it's just x-cart, but can anyone please confirm or at least bolster my suspicions?</p>

In my loop, I need to append data to my <code>totalValues</code> array, so I did this:</p>

<pre><code>memcpy(totalValues + totalCopied, tempBuffer, 600 * sizeof(float));
</code></pre>

<p>This is done inside a loop and <code>totalCopied</code> keeps track of how much data has been appended to <code>totalValues</code> so that I know where to write from when the loop hits memcpy again. I'm not sure why I get the ""exc bad access"" error, but my theory is that the memory is not contiguous and, therefore, the <code>totalValues + totalCopied</code> line might be causing trouble. I'm not sure if an error would be thrown in this case, or if the memory would just be overwritten anyway. The interesting thing is, it always occurs after 1023 loops. If I remove the 'memcpy' line, the program loops through without any problems. Any ideas what could be causing this?</p>

<p>EDIT - The cause was that the memory allocation was hard coded for another file. Normally, I won't know the length of the file before the memory allocation, so how can I ensure that enough memory is allocated at runtime?</p>

"349870","Is there a better way to assign permissions to temporary tables in MySQL?","<p>Our users log into the production database as a fairly low-level user, with SELECT granted at the database level, and INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE granted on the specific tables they need access to.</p>

<p>They also have permissions to create temporary tables (we need them for some of the more complicated queries). The problem is that whilst they can create the temporary tables, they don't have access to INSERT into them!</p>

<p>A workaround we have found is to create a ""real"" (persistent?) table of the same name (but with only one field) and grant access for them to insert into that. Then, when the temporary table is created with the same name, the system will use that, not the persistent table.</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `testing` (`id` INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, `name` VARCHAR(30));

<p>The set of sentences -- i.e. <em>closed</em> formulas -- of FOL is also decidable, because it's straightforward to decide whether a wff is a sentence. </p>

<p>But the set of sentences of FOL is <em>not</em> context free: if variables are encoded, say, with prme marks (so the set of variables is $x$, $x&#39;$, $x&#39;&#39;$, etc.), an easy application of the pumping lemma for context free languages to a sentence like $(\exists \mu)(F\mu\rightarrow F\mu)$, for a sufficiently long variable $\mu$, yields a contradiction.</p>

<p>So the best we can hope for, thanks to the Chomsky hierarchy, is that the set of sentences of FOL is context sensitive. Whether it is just rides on whether there is a linear bounded Turing machine that decides it.</p>

<p>I have two questions, then:</p>

<p>(1) what is the weakest Turing machine (TM) needed to decide the set of sentences of FOL? (if the answer is linear bounded, then the set of sentences of FOL is context sensitive; otherwise the best we can say is that the set of sentences of FOL is decidable)</p>

<p>and, more generally: </p>

<p>(2) is there a hierarchical structure for languages between context sensitive (type 1) and decidable? e.g., are there grammars naturally associated with polynomially bounded TM's, exponentially bounded TM's, etc.? Obviously I don't expect there to be as nice a structure here as elsewhere in the Chomsky hierarchy -- precisely because I can't seem to find a reference that talks about it. But since there is a natural ordering of Turing machines based on the amount of space they need, I'm curious about what this ordering might track on the side of grammars.</p>

"349880","Huffman ""terminator"" bitstring","<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Imagine a huffman compressed file that gets downloaded partially, like in P2P software, so we allocate disk space for the whole file first and then start downloading random file chunks. One of the huffman codes (but we don't know which) is an end code, so if this code is decoded, we stop. Assuming the file consists of several huffman compressed streams, we can try to decompress some of them before the download finished.</p>

<p>The way the disk space is preallocated is important now: Let's assume we have the start of a huffman stream, but it isn't complete, so we run into the preallocated disk space. Usually, this space is all 0, so we'd keep decoding symbols with huffman code <code>00..</code>. If this isn't our end code, we don't notice the ""invalid"" data and f.e. if there's 2 GB of preallocated space, we're doing much useless decoding.</p>

<p>So we'd like to preallocate the space in a way to make decoding stop as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>The question</h2>

<p>I'm looking for the shortest bitstring that acts as a ""Huffman terminator"", meaning if we decode this string, we'll decode every Huffman code at least once, so we'll definitely receive an end code. This should work for every combination of Huffman codes of length <code>1..n</code> bits.</p>

<p>Note: I know there are simple solutions to the hypothetical scenario above (using <code>00..</code> as an end code, using P2P segment data to detect chunks not downloaded yet), but this is just an example scenario to show a theoretical use of a ""Huffman terminator"" bitstring, I'm not interested in solving this scenario, but looking for algorithms/ways/ideas to generate/find bitstrings that act as ""Huffman terminator"" .</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Let's look at the possible Huffman code combinations for <code>n = 2</code>: <code>[0, 1]</code>, <code>[00, 01, 1]</code>, <code>[0, 10, 11]</code>, <code>[00, 01, 10, 11]</code>. Now let's start with a bitstring that contains every possible bit sequence of length <code>1..n</code> (<code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>00</code>, <code>01</code>, <code>10</code>, <code>11</code>):</p>

<p><code>001011</code></p>

<p>Decoding with the different Huffman code combinations gives (huffman codes are assigned to symbols <code>A..D</code>):</p>

<pre><code>Combination   Decoded symbols
[0, 1]        AABABB
[00,01,1]     ACBC
[0,10,11]     AABC
[00,01,10,11] ACD
</code></pre>

<p>This is a good start and it already decodes every Huffman code for the first three ones, but if we decode it with <code>[00, 01, 10, 11]</code>, we're missing symbol <code>B</code> (Huffman code <code>01</code>). So let's just append this to our bitstring:</p>

<p><code>00101101</code></p>

<p>This is a valid ""Huffman terminator"" for <code>n=2</code>, 8 bits in length. If we'd preallocate our disk space with this byte, we'd be sure to terminate all huffman codes that won't exceed 2 bits. We even know there won't be shorter terminator strings for <code>n=2</code> because it's the minimal length for the combination <code>[00, 01, 10, 11]</code> to decode each symbol once.</p>

<p>I also found a ""Huffman terminator"" for <code>n=3</code>, <code>0001011001110100111010011100010101111101110</code> (43 bits), but I'm not 100% sure if it's correct and I don't know if it's the shortest one.</p>

<h2>What I'm looking for</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Algorithms/ideas to find or generate Huffman terminators for a given <code>n</code>. My attempt would be similar to the example: generating a start string and appending bits as needed to satisfy all different Huffman code combinations. But I'm sure there are better ways.</p></li>
<li><p>Specific Huffman terminators, <code>n=8</code> and <code>n=16</code>, although it might be computational expensive to generate them and they will perhaps be very long.</p></li>
<li><p>Papers/links about this problem (or similar ones) if there are any.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bonus</h2>

<p>Bonus points for finding ""Huffman terminators"" that also work if we start at bit position <code>1..n</code>, so it even terminates if data was decoded before and we won't arrive and start a new huffman code at the first bit.</p>

"349919","Manipulating/Clearing Variables via Lists: Mathematica","<p>My problem (in <strong>Mathematica</strong>) is referring to variables given in a particular array and manipulating them in the following manner (as an example): </p>

<p><strong>Inputs</strong>: vars={x,y,z}, system=some ODE like x^2+3*x*y+...etc
(note that I haven't actually created variables x y and z)</p>

<p><strong>Aim</strong>:</p>

<p>To assign values to the variables in the list ""var"" with the intention of inputting these values into the system of ODEs. Then, once I am done, clear the values of the variables in the array vars so that it is in its original form {x,y,z} (and not something like {x,1,3} where y=1 and z=3). I want to do this by referring to the positional elements of vars (I aim not to know that x, y and z are the actual variables).</p>

<p>The reason why: I am trying to write a program that can have any number of variables and ODEs as defined by the user. Since the number of variables and the actual letters used for them are unknown, it is necessary to perform manipulations with the array itself.</p>

<p><strong>Attempt:</strong> </p>

<p>A fixed number of variables is easy. For the arbitrary case, I have tried modules and blocks, but with no success. Consider the following code: </p>

<p><code>Clear[x,y,z,vars,svars]</code></p>

<p><code>vars={x,y,z}</code></p>

<p><code>svars=Map[ToString,vars]</code></p>

<p><code>Module[{vars=vars,svars=svars},</code></p>

<p><code>Symbol[svars[[1]]]//Evaluate=1</code></p>

<p><code>]</code></p>

<p>then vars={1,y,z} and not {x,y,z} after running this. I have done functional programming with lists, atoms etc. Thus is makes sense to me that vars is changed afterwards, because I have changed x and not vars. However, I cannot get ""x"" in the list of variables to remain local. Of course I could put in ""x"" itself, but that is particular to this specific case. I would prefer to put something like: </p>

<p><code>Clear[x,y,z,vars,svars]</code></p>

<p><code>vars={x,y,z}</code></p>

<p><code>svars=Map[ToString,vars]</code></p>

<p><code>Module[{vars=vars,svars=svars, vars[[1]]},</code></p>

<p><code>Symbol[svars[[1]]]//Evaluate=1</code></p>

<p><code>]</code></p>

<p>which of course doesn't work because vars[[1]] is not a symbol or an assignment to a symbol.</p>

<p><strong>Other possibilities:</strong> 
I found a function </p>

<p><code>assignToName[name_String, value_] :=</code>
<code>ToExpression[name, InputForm, Function[var, var = value, HoldAll]]</code></p>

<p>which looked promising. Basically name_String is the name of the variable and value is its new value. I attempted to do: </p>

<p><code>vars={x,y,z}</code>
<code>svars=Map[ToString,vars]</code>
<code>vars[[1]]=//Evaluate=1</code>
<code>assignToName[svars[[1]],svars[[1]]]</code></p>

<p>but then something like<code>D[x^2, vars[[1]]]</code>  doesn't work (x is not a valid variable).</p>

<p>If I am missing something, or if perhaps I am going down the wrong path, I'm open to trying other things.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I am learning Java and want to create my own IRC client. I have two threads but the problem is that I do not always get a response from server (can't see PING) and it lags for my message to be delivered.</p>

<p>I thought it was related to thread not having a sleep, but it turns out it's not.</p>

<p>When I connect to the server I send the following commands to identify myself and privatemsg self:</p>

I can represent it's pose by either a translation vector + rotation matrix or a 6 element parameter vector (X, Y, Z, roll, pitch, yaw).</p>

<p>The problem is that the output generated by the cameras is noisy, and I'd like to filter some of that noise off by smoothing the poses in 3D.</p>

<p>Any pointers on that? What fitting works better for multidimensional problems?</p>

Then $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{f(k)}$ converges if and only if $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{-1}(k)}{k^2}$ converges, where $f^{-1}$ denotes the inverse of $f$. </p>

<p>I saw this claim as an exercise in a analysis textbook, linked from this site. Can not remember which one unfortunately. It was listed as a challenging exercise and has proven too challenging for me.  </p>

<p>My initial idea was to try to use the integral test. $\sum \frac{1}{f(k)}$ converges exactly when $\int \frac{1}{f(x)}$ converges. I thought I might do some smart change of variable to find that $\int \frac{f^{-1}(x)}{x^2}$ converges. I could not come up with one however and I also realized that I do not know that the sum $\sum \frac{f^{-1}(k)}{k^2}$ satisfies the conditions for using the integral test.

<ol>
<li>if the pool has less than corePoolSize threads, kick off a new thread for a new task;</li>
<li>if the pool has more than corePoolSize threads and all are busy, kick off a new thread for a new task until maxPoolSize is reached. In that case, reject the task;</li>
<li>keep corePoolSize number of threads alive even if they are idling, <strong>excess threads will die if they have been idle for more than keepAliveTime</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>According the Java6 docs, keepAliveTime should work as above. But in my test code, it doesn't work consistently.</p>

<p>When I set keepAliveTime to 0, it works fine, always keeping core threads alive and terminating excess threads when they finish;<br>
but, as shown below, when I set keepAliveTime to a positive value, it seems that it terminate ALL idle threads, no matter they are core threads or not.</p>

<p>Is there a way to append a field with a value to the end of an existing query so that I can still access the record set in PHP with a mysql_fetch_array() command?</p>

<p>essentially I want to query for any records with the product ID, and then append multiple additional fields.</p>

<p>After thining about it i was actualyl wondering if I can include an array within the records set (i.e. the array of results for the meta data) and access that through PHP?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT offers.*, c.short_name AS sponsorName, c.logo AS sponsorLogo

<p>I want to add those two fields to the record up top .. but don't know how to append all fields within a query result into a single already existing record.</p>

<p><strong>--SOLVED--</strong></p>

<p><strong>Query has been adjusted to account for GROUP_CONCAT as follows</strong></p>

<pre><code>SELECT
offers.*,
s.short_name AS sponsorName,
s.logo AS sponsorLogo,
GROUP_CONCAT( mn.title) titles,
GROUP_CONCAT( mo.`name`) metas
FROM offers

"349943","Using jQuery to Add a Class Attribute to images, etc. on Page?","<p>Li'l Help? Apologies in advance due to my jQuery.noob status, but I'm drawing a blank and about out of ideas on why this isn't working.  Maybe someone here can see something I'm not? I'd surely appreciate any help.</p>

<h2><strong>The Issue</strong></h2>

<p>This webpage has several images on it (also paragraphs, etc.) that I want to add a class to.  They don't currently have a class on them.</p>

<h2><strong>Why I want to Add a Class</strong></h2>

<p>I want to use CSS3 to target that class and style anything that has it.  More specifically this is going to be a pop-in menu and I'd like to adjust the opacity of it and animate its entry &amp; exit.</p>

<h2><strong>How I'm attempting to do This</strong></h2>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery-1.7.2.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(""document"").ready(function() {
        $(""img"").addClass(""menumain"");
                   alert(""Here I am!""); //This alert will go when I figure this out, I just added it to see if it pops up (it does).
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>I've Also Tried it This Way (<em>Note: All of my images contain the string ""menumain-"" in the file names</em>)</strong></h2>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""../jquery-1.7.2.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(""document"").ready(function() {
        $(""img[src*=menumain-]"").attr({class:""menumain""});

    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>So What Happens When I Try it?</strong></h2>

<p>Nothing. I load the page, (that alert does pop up, which I dismiss) then expand out the body using firebug and / or Safari developer tools, etc. and drill down to the images on the page. I see the image attributes, but I don't see where the class was added, much less defined as ""menumain"" which is what I want the class to be.</p>

<h2><strong>Part of Why This is Driving me Crazy</strong></h2>

<p>I have another jQuery script on the same page which does something similar. It adds attributes, not a Class attribute, but other attributes to the main Div which surrounds the whole page. I don't have any problems with that jQuery function, so I don't see why this one isn't working.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Might it Not Be Working</strong></h2>

<p>I've checked the syntax 9 ways from Sunday, but I don't see anything wrong. Still, you know how proof reading syntax can be.</p>

<p>Secondly the images I'm targeting (I'm also going to try to get the text and buttons in the menu tagged in this same class) are buried down in Divs like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""image194"" style=""visibility: inherit;""&gt;
     &lt;a name=""image194anc""&gt;
          &lt;img width=""317"" height=""564"" border=""0"" alt=""menumain-bg-317x564""    src=""images/menumain-bg-317x564.png"" name=""image194Img""&gt;
     &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming that my targeting of <em>$(""img[src</em>=menumain-]"")* will find those images whether they are in Divs or not, but maybe I'm wrong on that?</p>

<h2><strong>One More Thing</strong></h2>

<p>This ""web page"" is generated by an application called Lectora by Trivantis. It's a WYSIWYG authoring tool for instructional designers (who are NOT web developers) who create on line training. So it's not as if I'm creating this whole thing in DreamWeaver or can change the entire approach to the web design. But I should be able to pop a class on a set of page elements and target them with CSS, no?</p>

<p>Please tell me if you see anything wrong.  Here's a version of the page --> <a href=""http://bit.ly/Rijnl8"">http://bit.ly/Rijnl8</a></p>

<li>I use dynamic imports to implement some kind of plugin behavior, it is perhaps not the best possible design, but it would be sweet if I had not to refactor this for now</li>
</ul>

<p>I have the source code for everything I use, and everything is under libre licenses, so I don't have issues with compiling to PE or porting 2.7 scripts to 3, but it would be a tedious work. The only solution I have found so far is to port everything to Python 3. Can you think of another one?</p>

print f.count() # prints 3

<p><code>@countcalls</code>
   <code>def f():

</ol>

<p>Is <code>@countcalls</code> equivalent to creating a <code>countcalls</code> object and passing the function below to its <code>__init__</code> method?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <code>__call__</code> is taking three arguments. <code>self</code> is fine as far as the question above is answered. What the hell are the two other arguments: <code>*args, **kwargs</code> and what are they achieving?</p></li>

"349961","Centralised Integration framework","<p>We are looking to centralise our Integration in our company and I'm wondering what sort of solutions other have for this and what the best way to approach it would be. At the moment we have different types on integration running different lanuages, different frameworks on different servers so we are looking to move them all to a single framework to make it easier to manage.</p>

<p>Some of the current Integration includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>SQL Server scheduled tasks (on 3 or 4 servers)</li>
<li>SQL Server Integration services (on 2 or 3 servers)</li>
<li>Console applications (.NET on 2 Servers)</li>
<li>Windows Services (.NET on 2 servers)</li>
</ul>

<p>What we are after is:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 server that manages all integration jobs scheduling (so this only needs to be setup once and we always know where to find it)</li>
<li>A job monitor that displays the history of jobs run (Much like the SQL Server Job Activity monitor)</li>
<li>Jobs might need to run custom .NET code, here some sort of API might be used to allow for more flexibility over SQL Server Integration Services</li>

"349962","Recommendation on building web services on Linux with minimal dependencies","<p>I need a recommendation for a framework/library for building web services on a Linux system. I have the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should have minimal dependencies, e.g. preferably not require any VM like Java or Mono.</li>
<li>My service implementation should have access to the native system APIs, preferably it should be possible to call C APIs directly.</li>
<li>If possible, the solution should not depend on a large web server installation. As I understand, Axis/C++ would require an Apache server, right? Is there anything that allows for writing some kind of ""self-hosted"" web service like in .NET (<code>ServiceHost</code>) on Linux? I would really like something that works as a standalone daemon in the end.</li>
<li>The resulting services should be standard-compliant as I need to make cross-platform calls. Most importantly, I need WS-Security.</li>
<li>The solution must be Open Source, the actual licence is less important.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any suggestions, please post (web links would be nice ;-))</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; '/memory_books/new', :fbookupload =&gt; ""yes"" %&gt;

<p>and in the partial...I have tried to get the content of fbookupload by using:</p>

<p>How can I have the partial pass along the parameter :fbookupload?</p>

"349966","What would make PerformanceCounterCategory.Exists hang indefinitely?","<p>I've got an application that uses performance counters, that has worked for months. Now, on my dev machine and another developers machine, it has started hanging when I call PerformanceCounterCategory.Exists. As far as I can tell, it hangs indefinitely. It does not matter which category I use as input, and other applications using the API exhibits the same behaviour.</p>

<p>Debugging (using MS Symbol Servers) has shown that it is a call to Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey that hangs. Further investigation shows that it is this line that hangs:</p>

<pre><code>while (Win32Native.ERROR_MORE_DATA == (r = Win32Native.RegQueryValueEx(hkey, name, null, ref type, blob, ref sizeInput))) { 
</code></pre>

<p>This is basically a loop that tries to allocate enough memory for the performance counter data. It starts at <code>size = 65000</code> and does a few iterations. In the 4th call, when <code>size = 520000</code>, <code>Win32Native.RegQueryValueEx</code> hangs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, rather worringly, I found this comment in the reference source for PerformanceCounterLib.GetData:</p>

<pre><code>    // Win32 RegQueryValueEx for perf data could deadlock (for a Mutex) up to 2mins in some 
    // scenarios before they detect it and exit gracefully. In the mean time, ERROR_BUSY,
    // ERROR_NOT_READY etc can be seen by other concurrent calls (which is the reason for the 
    // wait loop and switch case below). We want to wait most certainly more than a 2min window. 
    // The curent wait time of up to 10mins takes care of the known stress deadlock issues. In most
    // cases we wouldn't wait for more than 2mins anyways but in worst cases how much ever time 
    // we wait may not be sufficient if the Win32 code keeps running into this deadlock again
    // and again. A condition very rare but possible in theory. We would get back to the user
    // in this case with InvalidOperationException after the wait time expires.

"349974","Spring MVC 3 Design","<p>I am working on a Spring MVC3 application and I have a requirement to enable/disable a link in a page and provide a tool tip on the link (some kind of help), if the link is disabled. The link can be disabled in many scenarios and I would like to know the various layers that should be impacted.</p>

<p>For example, consider a test case where an admin user is trying to renew a subscription. I should be able to renew if</p>

<ol>
<li>I am an admin user</li>
<li>My subscription is ending in the next 30 days</li>
<li>I am not renewing my own subscription.</li>
</ol>

<p>In my case, I have the controller, call a service that determines whether the user is eligible for renewal. If not eligible for renewal, then call another service that provides the help text. The view (JSP) then enables/disables the link and also displays the help text based on modelAttribute.</p>

<p>My question is..</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I avoid two calls to the service (Which seems to invoke the same methods again). I can add an attribute to the User model to hold the help text but I am not sure if the help text should be in the model</p></li>
<li><p>How to pull the renewal help text from a property file instead of hardcoding in the service. I am using messages.properties in the validator but I am not sure how to use it in a @service.</p></li>
<li><p>Should I just hard code the renewal help in the View (JSP) instead of over engineering it?</p></li>
</ol>

"349975","Can GAE oauth tokens be made portable across different versions of one app?","<p>The docs say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that authorization is associated
  with the domain used to access the
  endpoints: an access token produced
  using endpoints on one domain cannot
  be used to access the app using a
  different domain. If the access token
  came from a version-specific
  appspot.com domain, it can only be
  used to access that version of the
  app, and only at that domain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this isn't the behavior that I'm seeing.  I have multiple versions of my app running against my custom domain (<em>not appspot!</em>), and when I switch which version is the default, all the tokens made with the version that <em>used to be the default</em> are no longer valid.  The invalidated tokens were made on the same custom domain that is now mapped to the newly default-ed version of the app, and yet they're still invalidated.  This basically destroys my ability to switch default versions, as doing so will inconvenience every single user.  </p>

<p>Is this the expected behavior?  Is there any way to get around it?</p>

"349979","MongoDB - One Collection Using Indexes","<p>Ok so the more and more I develop in Mongodb i start to wonder about the need for multiple collections vs having one large collection with indexes (since columns and fields can be different for each document unlike tabular data).  If i am trying to develop in the most efficient way possible (meaning less code and reusable code) then can I use one collection for all documents and just index on a field.  By having all documents in one collection with indexes then i can reuse all my form processing code and other code since it will all be inserting into the same collection.  </p>

<p>For Example: </p>

<p>Lets say i am developing a contact manager and I have two types of contacts ""individuals"" and ""businesses"".  My original thought was to create a collection called individuals and a second collection called businesses.  But that was because im used to developing in sql where yes this would be appropriate since columns would be different for each table.  The more i started to think about the flexibility of document dbs the more I started to think, ""do I really need two collections for this?""  If i just add a field to each document called ""contact type"" and index on that, do i really need two collections?  Since the fields/columns in each document do not have to be the same for all (like in sql) then each document can have their own fields as long as i have a ""document type"" field and an index on that field.  </p>

<p>So then i took that concept and started to think, if i only need one collection for ""individuals"" and ""businesses"" then do i even need a separate collection for ""Users"" or ""Contact History"" or any other data.  In theory couldn't i build the entire solution in once collection and just have a field in each document that specifield the ""type"" and  index on it such as ""Users"", ""Individual Contact"", ""Business Contacts"", ""Contact History"", etc, and if it is a document related to another document i can index on the ""parent key/foreign"" Id field...</p>

<p>This would allow me to code the front end dynamically since the form processing code would all be the same (inserting into the same collection).  This would save a lot of coding but i want to make sure by using indexes and secondary indexes that the db would still run fast and not cause future problems as the collection grew.  As you can imagine, if everything was in one collection there might be hundreds of thousands even millions of documents in this collection as the user base grows but it would have indexes and secondary indexes to optimize performance.</p>

<p>My question is:  Is this a common method mongodb developers use?  Why or why not? What are the downfalls, if any?  If this is a commonly used method, please also give any positives to using this method.  thank you. </p>

"349980","Google App Engine Global Variables(ServletContext)","<p>I'm trying to build a chat application on GAE in JAVA . I have the need to keep count of all online users and their networks (chat rooms of some sort) , and this info needs to be updated constantly .
I have (wrongly?) assumed that I can just use Java's SerlvetContext and Set/Get Attribute methods to update online\offline users and share that information with all servlets . As I have come to know(with lovely bugs) , since GAE is distributed\cloud service , it doesn't effectively implement ServletContext.setAttribute - meaning is that my app probably runs on more than one JVM , and information on ServletContext is shared only between servlets belonging to the same JVM. </p>

<p>This is a huge problem for me , of course . 
Several Questions - 
1)Does ServletContext indeed won't work properly on GAE?
2)Is GAE a bad choice for beginner web developpers like myself ? It seems to me that I always find new problems and things that don't correspond with Servlet\JSP rules. Since it is hard enough for a beginner to learn Servlets , maybe GAE isn't the right choice?
3)How then can I share information between Servlets ? </p>

<p>What does this mean? Googling around, I see someone on MSDN who seems to have had the same issue but unfortunately never got an answer to his questions. Has anyone seen this issue before?</p>

"349993","Managing software updates for daemons -- ensuring they are not running","<p>I have a general question regarding the right way to do software updates on OS X. My application runs two daemons, both as root. One of the daemons can download the software update package from the network. When downloaded it must install the new binaries, including two binaries replacing the current ones for the daemons. Since both the daemons are currently running, replacing them might be a issue. Hence I have few ideas, however it would helpful to get expert advice on the same.</p>

<p>Method 1: After downloading the update, it can be kept in some location. The update daemon can  place a bash script in another specified location and create a plist which can be placed in the LaunchDaemons directory to be triggered during the next reboot. The script simply replaces both the binaries before startup. This is possible only if we can ensure that the two daemons do not start up before my script executes. I didn't find a good way to tell launchd to run my script first, before starting the daemons. So I am not quite sure if this is a good solution.</p>

<p>Method 2: After download, immediately launch a script using launchd programatically. This should be possible, right? The script waits for a TERM signal like shown here <a href=""https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3636062?start=0&amp;tstart=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3636062?start=0&amp;tstart=0</a> to actually replace the binaries and exit gracefully. Again the problem is, when my script gets launched, I must be sure that my daemons are shut down before replacing the binaries. I am not sure how to do this.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest which is the better approach and also let me know of any better way? </p>

<p>Here's how I currently do this:</p>

<p>// In the main view controller I have a method called openSecondView that is defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) openSecondView:(id)sender {
    SecondViewController *secondView = [[SecondViewController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];
    [self presentModalViewController:secondView animated:YES];
}
</code></pre>

<p>// In the SecondViewController I have a back button that calls a method called closeView that is defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)closeView:(id)sender {
    [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, how do you do properly accomplish this? </p>

<p>Should I call <strong>[secondView release]</strong> after calling <strong>presentModalViewController</strong> or is this done some what behind the scenes? I ask this because when I was debugging I noticed that presentModalViewController doesn't seem to be a blocking code, the next few lines of code I added seem to execute immediately, without calling <strong>dismissModalViewControllerAnimated</strong>. Are there any consequences of calling <strong>[secondView release]</strong> after <strong>presentModalViewController</strong>?</p>

<p>Any help/advise would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>But that is the regular pdf viewer like in the browser.  I don't want that.  I want full Adobe Standard or Professional functionality in my C# application using the Adobe controls.  For example, if I use the code above, it loads in the C# app and I can see the adobe toolbar (print, save, etc.)  But it is useless to me because I need things like save which cannot be done with the activex viewer above.  Specifically, you cannot save, just as you cannot within the broswer.</p>

<p>So, I referenced the acrobat.dll and am trying to use:</p>

<pre><code>Acrobat.AcroAVDocClass _acroDoc = new Acrobat.AcroAVDocClass();
Acrobat.AcroApp _myAdobe = new Acrobat.AcroApp();
Acrobat.AcroPDDoc _pdDoc = null;
_acroDoc.Open(myPath, ""test"");
pdDoc = (Acrobat.AcroPDDoc)(_acroDoc.GetPDDoc());
_acroDoc.SetViewMode(2);
_myAdobe.Show();

<p>It opens adobe acrobat but it opens it outside of my c# application.  I need it to open in my c# application like the activex library does.  Can it be done with these libraries?</p>

<p>If I cannot open it in my c# application I would like to be able to ""hold"" my c# app tied to it so the c# app knows when I close the adobe app.  At least that way I'd have some measure of control.  This means I would hit open, the adobe app opens.  I close the adobe app, my C# app is aware of this and loads the newly changed doc with the activex library (because I don't need change ability anymore, just displaying.)</p>

<p>I have the full versions of adobe acrobat installed on my computer.  It is not the reader.</p>

<p>The proof is proof by contradiction, and the goal is to find a way to compute halt, given a supposed algorithm for sotrue(P). Assuming that soTrue can be computed, I want to reach the contradiction that halt is computable. Here is the algorithm I created:</p>

"350031","Galois Field Fourier Transform","<p>there are two definitions for Reed-Solomon codes, as transmitting points and as BCH code ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction</a> ). On Wikipedia there is written that we can transform from one definition to second by using Fourier transform.</p>

<p>So for example there is RS(7, 3) (length of codeword is 7, so codeword is maximally 7 - 1 = 6 degree polynomial and degree of message polynomial is maximally 3 - 1 = 2) code with generator polynomial $g(x)=x^4 + \alpha^3 x^3 + x^2 + \alpha x + \alpha^3 = (x-\alpha)(x-\alpha^2)(x-\alpha^3)(x-\alpha^4)$.</p>

<p>Let message polynomial be for example $m(x) = \alpha x^2 + \alpha x + 1$.</p>

<p>So following the definition that there is created BCH-style codeword (from definition):</p>

<p>Systematic codeword is $c_{sys}(x)=x^4m(x) + (x^4m(x)) \bmod g(x)=\alpha x^6 + \alpha x^5 + x^4 + \alpha^5 x^3 + x^2 + \alpha^2 x + \alpha^5$.</p>

<p>Non-systematic codeword is $c_{nonsys}(x)=m(x)g(x)= \alpha x^6 + \alpha^2 x^5 + \alpha^6 x^4 + \alpha^6 x^3 + \alpha^3 x^2 + \alpha^2 x + \alpha^3$.</p>

<p>And the codeword created with second definition (transmitting points):</p>

<p>$c_{tp}(x) = m(\alpha^5)x^6 + m(\alpha^4)x^5 + m(\alpha^3)x^4 + m(\alpha^2)x^3 + m(\alpha)x^2 + m(1)x + m(0) $
$= \alpha x^6 + \alpha x^5 + \alpha^4 x^4 + \alpha^6 x^3 + \alpha^4 x^2 + x + 1$.</p>

<p>So now I tried to check equivalence of these two codeword creation methods. As it is written on Wikipedia: $c_{tp_i} = c_{nonsys}(\alpha^i)$ and Galois Field Fourier Transform should be used.</p>

<p>I tried to compute it for $0...\alpha^5$, $1...\alpha^6$, $\alpha^5...0$, $\alpha^6...0$ and the result is always incorrect.</p>

<p>So the question is: when it is given codeword created with BCH-encoding scheme then how to transform it to equivalent codeword created with transmitting point scheme and vice versa?</p>

"350044","Javascript: Comparing to null - !== vs !=","<p>Ok, so I installed Linter on my Sublime editor while working on my node.js app. One of the things that it caught said that I should always use !== to compare an object to null (I usually use != ).</p>

<p>So I changed it...but then I noticed that the !== wasn't working.</p>

<p>I have this scenario:</p>

<pre><code>var x = null;
if (x !== null)
    console.log('x is not equal to null');
</code></pre>

<p>When I use the !== the console printed that line even though it was obviously not true. When I switched it back to != it behaved normally.</p>

<p>So my question is, why is linter telling me to use !== if it doesn't do what I want it to...</p>

<p>I know I am missing something.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
Ok, so it may be a bit more complicated than I originally thought. In my real code I was using !== with the node.js GLOBAL object.</p>

<pre><code>console.log('Global User: ' + GLOBAL.User);

if (GLOBAL.User != null)
{
    console.log('User is not null');
}
</code></pre>

<p>The console line prints even when GLOBAL.User is null...</p>

<p>Perhaps this object is special?</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so after reading through the comments and looking at my code, I have learned that !== can have issues if the object is undefined rather than null (see this post: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/801032/why-is-null-an-object-and-whats-the-difference-compared-to-undefined?lq=1"">Why is null an object and whats the difference compared to undefined</a>).</p>

<p>So in my case, my global variable could be, depending on when this method is called, undefined, null, or full of data. I am going to go back and update my code so that it is never undefined and then !== will work consistently.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

"350045","How to monitor Textfile and continuously output content in a textbox","<p>I'm making a program that controls a game server. One of the functions I'm making is a live server logfile monitor.</p>

<p>There is a logfile (a simple textfile) that gets updated by the server as it runs.</p>

<p>How do I continuously check the logfile and output it's content in a RichTextBox?</p>

<p>I did this simple function just try and get the content of the log.
It will of course just get the text row by row and output it to my textbox.
Also it will lock the program for as long as the loop runs, so I know it's useless. </p>

<pre><code>public void ReadLog()
{
  using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(""server.log""))

    String line;

    // Read and display lines from the file until the end of the file is reached.
    while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)
    {
      monitorTextBox.AppendText(line + ""\n"");
      CursorDown();
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But how would you go about solving the live monitoring as simple as possible?</p>

<p><strong>* EDIT *</strong></p>

<p>I'm using Prescots solution. great stuff.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm using a sstreamreader to put the text from the file to my textbox.  I ran into the problem is that, whenever I tried to access any of the gui controls in my event handler the program just stopped with no error or warnings.</p>

<p>I found out that it has to do with threading. I solved that like this:</p>

<pre><code>private void OnChanged(object source, FileSystemEventArgs e)
{
    if (monitorTextField.InvokeRequired)
    {
        monitorTextField.Invoke((MethodInvoker)delegate { OnChanged(source, e); });
    }
    else
    {
      StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(""file.txt"");

      monitorTextField.Text = """";
      monitorTextField.Text = reader.ReadToEnd();
      reader.Close();
      CursorDown();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now my only problem is that the file.txt is used by the server so I can't access it, since it's ""being used by another process"". I can't control that process.. so maybe I'm out of luck.</p>

<p>But the file can be opened in notepad while the serevr is running, so somehow it must be possible. Perhaps I can do a temp copy of the file when it updates and read the copy. Dunno...</p>

"350049","Connecting to a remote server and switching user with bash/expect","<p>First post, thanks in advance for any help. </p>

<p>I'm somewhat new to scripting in general but I've managed to build a nice wrapper in bash that's designed to collect some variables and then make some connections to a couple of remote boxes and do some things related to a web statistics system and launch some hadoop processes. Basically a series of tedious tasks that I'm trying to automate. (unnecessary details complete). </p>

<p>The problem I'm running into is finding a way to effectively connect to those remove servers, authenticate as as a regular user, then switch users for various tasks. Here's the relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>    #!/bin/sh
    #Script's run as root. this asks for the sudoers pass
    read -p ""Enter password for $SUDO_USER: "" -s password
    #Defines some testing commands I want to pass to a remote box
    CMD=""hostname; id; sudo su -; id; pwd;""
    #launches an expect script with some defined variables as arguments.
    /home/ME/scripts/derp.expect $SUDO_USER $definedremoteserver ""$command"" ""$password""
</code></pre>

<p>Now the expect script being used: </p>

<pre><code>    #!/usr/bin/expect
    #expect script to help with SSH connections for the urchinizer bash script
    set arg1 [lindex $argv 0]
    set arg2 [lindex $argv 1]
    set arg3 [lindex $argv 2]
    set arg4 [lindex $argv 3]
    spawn ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no $arg1@$arg2 ""$arg3""
    expect ""password:""
    send ""$arg4\r""
    interact
    expect ""password""
    send ""$arg4\r""
    interact
</code></pre>

<p>I'm having trouble determining why this fails. I've researched quite a bit and have tried numerous variations of the code. Basically when I run this, it takes my pass and I'm able to make the initial connection. Then the script tries to switch user and the second expect fails. The first 'id' and 'hostname' output successfully. When the user switch happens, the second expect doesn't work and I'm left with just a password prompt. I enter my pass anyway (which displays in plain text for some reason) and the script just hangs without outputting the second 'id' and 'pwd' commands I'm trying to use to verify that this is working. </p>

<p>If I actually login to that box and do a sudo -i or sudo su - this is what the password prompt looks like:</p>

<pre><code>    [sudo] password for my.name:
</code></pre>

<p>So for the second (not working) expect, I've tried a few different variations with somewhat different results but no success. </p>

<p>Sorry for the long post. This has been driving be nuts. Is what I'm trying to do possible? Is there a smarter way to handle this? Anyone spot any obvious mistakes? Also, a secondary question... how do wildcards work in those expect lines? </p>

If there is actually no equivalent function or library exposed in Metro/WinRT then that would make a custom text input box VERY difficult to bring to market in non-US countries.
Specific example: in my custom control, if a french keyboard user presses the è,ù,é, or à keys, they are unable to be translated to the correct character. For example, è uses the scan code for VirtualKey.Number7, and as far as I can tell there is no way to know the keyboard layout or no easy way to translate that scancode based on the current keyboard layout.

Now they also want that data backed up offsite, the only problem is each of those computers have a separate PST that range from 3 - 7 gb and I'm afraid those files would have to be reuploaded in full everytime a user opens up their outlook.</p>

It might be two minipages side by side, or a code listing followed by boxed output, or whatever. For a trivial example, we might see</p>

<p><code>\[ sin \theta \]</code> next to its output, <em>sin</em> θ</p>

<p>Whenever I've done this, I had to use two copies of the code, e.g., once inside <code>verbatim</code> and once inside a minipage or framed box). This just begs for inconsistencies and maintainability problems, since it's very easy to fix one copy and not the other. So, <strong>is there any way to display a bunch of code <em>and</em> to execute (a copy of) it, showing the results?</strong></p>

<p>I'm pretty sure it's not straightforward: the code needs to have different catcodes for reading and displaying, but catcodes get assigned only once, when the text is encountered. But if there's no better way, it should be doable by reading the code verbatim and saving a copy in the <code>.aux</code> file, from where it'll get read and interpreted the next time around. But I've never seen such a thing. Has anyone else here?</p>

"350120","Why does protocol buffers deserialization get faster if performed multiple times?","<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>
  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/504103/how-do-i-write-a-correct-micro-benchmark-in-java"">How do I write a correct micro-benchmark in Java?</a>  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>While testing the performance of protocol buffers, I've realized that if I perform the same deserialization multiple times, the total time is much lower per each deserialization operation. 
I've written the following code to figure out what is going on, and found out that the first deserialization is always slower than the following ones. The following code has two loops which use the same byte array to keep disk access performance out of the test case. 
Builders are created from scratch, and I'm incrementing a dummy counter to stop JVM from being smart and not executing code just in case it can detect that the outputs are not used anyway. (you never know, right?)</p>

<p>Here are some measurements with various number of loops for the first and second for loop:</p>

<p>first loop: 1 time, second loop 1 time: 
first deserialization 34ms
second deserialization: 8ms</p>

<p>first loop: 10 times, second loop 1 time: 
first deserialization 95ms
second deserialization: 3ms</p>

<p>first loop: 100 times, second loop 1 time: 
first deserialization 147ms
second deserialization: 0ms</p>

<p>I've debugged the code and I could not see anything being cached in the builders, and they are recreated anyway. So what is the reason for this behaviour? I have a very critical piece of code that needs to deserialize a binary blog, and I'm trying to find out how I can avoid the performance penalty that seems to hit the first operation</p>

<p>Here is my test code, it should be easy to test it with another protobuf message. </p>

        fis.read(bytes);

    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my accordion DIV, I call several user controls, one for each accordion section:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""accordion1""&gt;
        &lt;DT:TrainerCost ID=""dtTrainerCost"" runat=""server"" Visible=""false"" /&gt;

        &lt;DT:ProfessionalInfo ID=""dtProfessionalInfo"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These controls have in them an ASP:MultiView with two indexes 0 and 1. They default to 0. There's a button in Index0 which if clicked, launches View1.</p>

<p>When I display the default Index0 (on page load) everything with the accordion works well. But on clicking the button that triggers View1, I lose the jQuery accordion functionality... as per the other post, seems like jQuery bindings are being broken when the multi-view switches?</p>

Do we need recompile our assembly in 64 bit machine to get faster response in 64 bit environment ?<br />

if a dll is complied in 32 bit is it wise to run only in 32 bit iis to get faster performance

"350149","MVC Stream outputting to HTML div","<p>Small problem here with an MVC app that I'm not sure how to figure out a way around. </p>

<p>Basically, I'm adding additional functionality to a system that was originally created by someone else (c#). For a reporting system, the results were only ever displayed on screen. Now I am building in the functionality to allow the user the ability to download their report as an Excel document. </p>

<p>So basically, I have a view that displays the date ranges, and some other search refinement options to the user. I have introduced a radio button that if selected will download the report as opposed to displaying it on screen. </p>

<p>Here are my three actions within the ReportController:</p>

<pre><code>    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }


    public ActionResult ProductReport(AdminReportRequest reportRequest, FormCollection formVariables)
    {
        AdminEngine re = new AdminEngine();

        if (!reportRequest.Download)
        {
            AdminReport report = re.GetCompleteAdminReport(reportRequest);

            return View(report);
         }

            Stream ExcelReport = re.GetExcelAdminReport(reportRequest);
            TempData[""excelReport""] = ExcelReport;

        return RedirectToAction(""ExcelProductReport"");

       }

    public FileResult ExcelReport()
    {
        var ExcelReport = TempData[""excelReport""] as Stream;

        return new FileStreamResult(ExcelReport, ""application/ms-excel"")
        {
            FileDownloadName = ""Report"" + DateTime.Now.ToString(""MMMM d, yyy"") + "".xls""
        }; 
    } 
</code></pre>

<p>I've debugged through the AdminEngine, and everything looks fine. However, in the ExcelReport action, when it comes to returning the file - it doesn't. What I see is a lot of characters on screen (in the 'panelReport' div - see below), mixed in with what would be the data in the excel file. </p>

<p>I think I have established that the reason it is being displayed on screen is as a result of some code </p>

<p>that was written in the Index view:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% using (Ajax.BeginForm(""ProductReport"", ""Report"", null,
                      new AjaxOptions
                      {
                          UpdateTargetId = ""panelReport"",
                          InsertionMode = InsertionMode.Replace,
                          OnSuccess = ""pageLoaded"",
                          OnBegin = ""pageLoading"",
                          OnFailure = ""pageFailed"",
                          LoadingElementId = """"
                      },
                      new { id = ""SearchForm"" })) %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the Ajax.BeginForm statement states that it should update to the panelReport div - which is what it's doing (through the Product Report partial view). While this is perfect for when the reports need to be displayed on screen, it is obviously not going to work with an excel file.</p>

<p>Is there a way of working around this issue without changing the existing code too much?</p>

<p>Here is the class where I do the workings for the excel file in case it's required to shed light on the situation:</p>

<p>Report Class:</p>

<pre><code>public Stream GetExcelAdminReport(AdminReportRequest reportRequest)
{
        AdminReport report = new AdminReport();
        string dateRange = null;
        List&lt;ProductSale&gt; productSales = GetSortedListOfProducts(reportRequest, out dateRange);

        report.DateRange = dateRange;

        if (productSales.Count &gt; 0)
        {
            report.HasData = true;

            CustomisedSalesReport CustSalesRep = new CustomisedSalesReport();

            Stream SalesReport = CustSalesRep.GenerateCustomisedSalesFile(productSales);

            return SalesReport;
        }
}
</code></pre>

{
    public Stream GenerateCustomisedSalesFile(List&lt;ProductSale&gt; productSales)
    {
        MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
        HSSFWorkbook templateWorkbook = new HSSFWorkbook();

        HSSFSheet sheet = templateWorkbook.CreateSheet(""Sales Report"");

        //Workings

        templateWorkbook.Write(ms);
        ms.Position = 0;

<p>All advice I could find here and elsewhere on the net says the only place <code>CommandTimeout</code> can be set is in the code after the connection is set up and there is no other way to adjust the command timeout.</p>

<p>I'm about ready to start decompiling the executable to try to override/set the default value of the command timeout..</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how I can non-programmatically increase the command timeout value, get the command Timeout value set easily or some other (hopefully) more sensible solution?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>ps - I've been reading SO for quite a while now. My reputation stinks because I always find the answer without having to post.  You guys are awesome and I'm glad I finally found a way to get started!  </p>

"350166","Scope of Namespace","<p>I'm a C developer and just recently switch to C++ so namespace is new thing to learn.
The A class has a static method validate(), thus it can only access static variables or constants of the A class. But if the A.cpp has a constant defined in a namespace, the val() is able to use the constant and the code below was compiled properly.</p>

<p>A.h</p>

<pre><code>class A
{
    public:
    A();
    static bool validate(const int num);
};

A::A()
{
    // Do nothing. Just an example.
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>namespace A_local_constants
{
    const int val = 1;
}

using namespace A_local_constants;

bool A::validate(const int num)
{
    return (num == val);
}

<ol>
<li><p>Why is the static function validate() able to use the non-static constant val?</p></li>
<li><p>Where is the val created in the memory? </p></li>
<li><p>What scope is this constant?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it always created in the memory without the A object being created?</p></li>

"350174","MVVM - Summary/Detail","<p>So I'm trying to wrap my head around MVVM and I'm finding that I have more questions than answers.  The tutorials don't go far enough for me when it comes to the next step...</p>

<p>Basically I want a list of items and then a way to get the detail of each item.</p>

<p>Below is the examples that I've found online and they work great for displaying the list, but I need to know how I can use my VM to get the detail of this item.</p>

<pre><code>private IList&lt;item&gt; m_items;
private IList&lt;item&gt; m_Item;


private IList&lt;item&gt; getItemDetail(Int32 iId)
{
    var myItem =
        from i in items
        where i.iId == iId
        select i;

    m_Item = new List&lt;item&gt;();
    foreach (var item in myItem)
    {
        m_Item.Add(item);
    }
    return m_Item;
}

public myViewModel()
{

    m_items = new List&lt;item&gt;
    {        
    new item(1, ""test,),
    new item(2, ""test2""),
    new item(3, ""test1"")
    };

    m_Item = new List&lt;item&gt;();
    m_Item = getItemDetail(iId);

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I updated my View Model code above.  I think what I've done is I have added another List where when the user navigates to a detail page the view model gets called with the specific ID which then populates the detail List.  I probably don't need a list here but I wanted to try to keep it consistent with the main page code.</p>

<p>In my detail page I'm setting up the VM this way:</p>

<pre><code>    itemViewModel VM = new itemViewModel((Int32)navigationParameter);
    DataContext = VM;
</code></pre>

<p>When I break on the VM variable I see my 2 lists.  However, my binding doesn't work on the XAML.  If I need to post some sample XAML let me know.  I can do that but I'm hoping there is something I'm missing here.  </p>

<p>I'm trying to learn MVVM and I want to do things right.  So instead of continuing down a wrong path I would really like to know the ""right"" way of doing things.  So if you see errors, please let me know.</p>

"350195","Pending intent with Alarm not working in background service","<p>I have several pending intents that I'd like to create when broadcast reciever Boot action runs. Each intent sets off an alarm at a given time.  I was able to do this in an activity, however it is not working in a service. </p>

<p>It is strange because logcat shows the data is processing into the for loop and functions, but the alarm does not go off when the time is met. </p>

"350200","Zend Framework - Custom defined routes overridden when adding Zend_Rest_Route","<p>I'm creating an application that exposes a RESTful API in a module called <code>api</code>. For the other modules I created a little class that returns a <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Rewrite</code> object with custom defined routes:</p>

<pre><code>$router = new Zend_Controller_Router_Rewrite();
foreach ($this-&gt;_modules as $module) {
    if ($module === 'api') continue;
    foreach ($this-&gt;_getConfigFiles($module) as $filename) {
        $config = new Zend_Config_Ini($filename, 'routes');
        $router-&gt;addConfig($config, 'routes');
    }
}
return $router;
</code></pre>

<p>For the default module I have the following route:</p>

<pre><code>[routes]
routes.default_index_index.type = Zend_Controller_Router_Route
routes.default_index_index.route = /
routes.default_index_index.defaults.module = default
routes.default_index_index.defaults.controller = index
routes.default_index_index.defaults.action = index
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in my <code>Bootstrap</code> file file I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>$router = Shark_Module_Loader::getInstance()-&gt;getRouter();
$frontController-&gt;setRouter($router);
$frontController-&gt;getRouter()-&gt;removeDefaultRoutes();
$apiRoute = new Zend_Rest_Route($frontController, array(), array('api'));
$router-&gt;addRoute('rest', $apiRoute);
</code></pre>

<p>If I skip adding the rest route everything works fine for the default module, of course. But when I add the RESTful route the routes defined in the router are overridden(?), so the current route in the <code>index</code> action of the <code>index</code> controller of the <code>default</code> module (<code>$this-&gt;getFrontController()-&gt;getRouter()-&gt;getCurrentRoute();</code>) is an instance of Zend_Rest_Route. Thus, when trying to access a custom route defined in on of the route config files, lets say:</p>

<pre><code>...
routes.default_pages_view.type = Zend_Controller_Router_Route
routes.default_pages_view.route = /view/:page
routes.default_pages_view.defaults.module = default
routes.default_pages_view.defaults.controller = pages
routes.default_pages_view.defaults.action = view
...
</code></pre>

<p>I get a 404 error saying that the request action (<code>get</code>) is not present.</p>

<p>I already went through the docs and didn't see any hint that suggests this behavior.</p>

<p>Any help and guidance will be appreciated.</p>

<p>The queries are valid query objects. However, JSON is not being returned. Instead I get WDDX as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;wddxPacket version='1.0'&gt;
  &lt;header /&gt;
  &lt;data&gt;
    &lt;recordset rowCount='31'

        &lt;string&gt;2010-01-29T00:00:00+13:00&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;
    &lt;/recordset&gt;
  &lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/wddxPacket&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>function internetUsage(){   
    $.getJSON(""system.cfc"",{
        method:'getInternetUsage',
        SessionID:$(""#vSessionID"").val(),
        CustomerCode:$(""#vCustomerCode"").val(),
        FullUserName:$(""#selUser"").val(),
        StartDate:$(""#vStartDate"").val(),
        EndDate:$(""#vEndDate"").val(),
        returnformat:'json',
        queryformat:'column'
             },function(res,code){

         alert('hello');    // THIS NEVER FIRES!    
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, I tried getting the CFC to convert the query into JSON and returning the JSON-ified result. This worked a little better in that valid JSON was returned BUT it is still wrapped in <code>&lt;wddxPacket&gt;</code> tags, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;wddxPacket version='1.0'&gt;&lt;header/&gt;&lt;data&gt;&lt;string&gt;
{
    ""recordcount"": 31,
    ""columnlist"": ""callcharge,callreference,connduration,conntype,description,dest_number,pages,settingcount,startdate,starttime,subscribercode,usage"",
    ""data"": [
        {
            ""callcharge"": """",
            ""callreference"": """",
            ""connduration"": 86403,
            ""conntype"": ""UBS"",
            ""description"": ""dageorgetti"",
            ""dest_number"": """",
            ""pages"": """",
            ""settingcount"": 5,
            ""startdate"": ""2010-01-30T00:00:00+13:00"",
            ""starttime"": ""2010-01-30T00:00:00+13:00"",
            ""subscribercode"": ""dageorgetti"",
            ""usage"": 33.7300
        }...&lt;snip&gt;...
...&lt;snip&gt;...
&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/data&gt;&lt;/wddxPacket&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The call for achieving the above is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>function internetUsage(){   
    $.getJSON(""system.cfc"",{
        method:'getInternetUsage',
        SessionID:$(""#vSessionID"").val(),
        CustomerCode:$(""#vCustomerCode"").val(),
        FullUserName:$(""#selUser"").val(),
        StartDate:$(""#vStartDate"").val(),
        EndDate:$(""#vEndDate"").val(),
        jsonEncode:true // the cfc converts query to JSON
         },function(res,code){

              alert('Hello'); // still not firing       
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am using returntype=""JSON"" in the CFC. The cfc is quite complex and I don't think I need to paste it here. I can confirm that it is definitely generating valid query objects, which the conversion function seems to be successfully converting to valid JSON. I don't know why it comes back to the client wrapped in wddxPacket tags.</p>

<p>I would like to ajax for the external svg and insert the lollipop group into the current canvas. I would accept answers which ajax for the entire .svg and parse out the group (id=""lollipop"") to insert. It may be preferable, though, to copy just the group i want and save that as a text file which can be called upon and parsed. Either way. </p>

<p>I read the document <a href=""http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0/intro/getting-started-first-scala.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and it seems the way the example was done can be extended to do what I want to do, but I have a few concerns regarding this method...</p>

<p>1) How do we decide how many instances of Actors we should create? Do we have to do a trial/error thing to see which is the best, or is there some more intuitive way to go about it?</p>

<p>2) I am thinking of doing my task similarly to how the example was done - with a Master that spawns several Workers and communicate using case classes as messages. What I want to do is to find some metric between pairs of vertices (random walk), for all-pairs. I have a graph class that implements a method to calculate the metric given two vertices.</p>

<p>I will give each Worker two vertices 'u' and 'v' to calculate the metric for, and have workers return the value.</p>

<p>When the Master sends messages to Workers to calculate the metric, the Worker needs the graph structure - do I just do this by including the graph structure (i.e. adjacency list that is a HashMap) in the message? Will this cause any overhead by copying the graph structure each time, or do all workers just share that graph, or is there a better way to go about this?</p>

<p>3) Does the algorithm for calculating the metric between pairs of vertices need to be re-implemented to the extended Actor class, or is there a way for individual Actors to access the same graph structure to call the method (I guess this is similar to the question above about passing the entire graph structure as part of the message)?</p>

<p>""This is some long text"" will display ""This is some...""</p>

<p>This behaviour is correct, totally acceptable, and even expected, but I would like to know if the text was shortened or not. Is there any way to find if UILabel has shortened its content?</p>

<p>I need really simple solution, because I would like to use UILabel magic functionality like automatically reducing font size to fit etc. Sometimes the text will be just very long, so I will give user a way to see it all in another view after taping a button. But in the case the text wont be so long, I would like to hide that button to make interface simple.
Any idea how to achieve this will be appreciated.</p>

For example, in the application delegate class that is auto-generated when creating a new project, the <code>window</code> object is not declared in the <code>@interface</code> but just this way:</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIWindow *window;

<p>Then, in the implementation file, we have the <code>@synthesize window=_window;</code>.
And in the functions, we have either <code>self.window</code> OR <code>_window</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>[self.window makeKeyAndVisible]; // in didFinishLaunchingWithOptions function
[_window release]; // in dealloc function

<p>Can you explain me the difference, why there is nothing in the <code>@interface</code>, why we do <code>@synthesize window=_window;</code> instead of <code>@synthesize window;</code> and what is the difference between <code>self.window</code> and <code>_window</code>, I mean when do I have to call one more than the other?</p>

<p>It seems to me that, despite being one of the world's most used languages, even some of the leading experts of JavaScript like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford"">Doug Crockford</a> think JavaScript suffers from some pretty big design flaws (<em><a href=""http://www.crockford.com/javascript/javascript.html"">JavaScript: The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language</a></em>) that make development confusing and ambigious.</p>

"350249","Calculate BMI From Height / Weight tables","<p><strong>Clarification</strong></p>

<p>Upon working through your answers and reading your interpretations of this question, I have the following to add.</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to generate the entire BMI history, not a single value.</li>
<li>Every value in both tables needs to be paired (if possible) to a relevant value in the other table. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Simple Problem</strong></p>

<p><strike>Given an entry in PatientHeight, compute the BMI(Body Mass Index) with all entries in PatientWeight whose EntryDate falls between the current PatientHeight EntryDate and the previous PatientHeight EntryDate. This is true unless there are EntryDates in PatientWeight that are > then any EntryDates in PatientHeight. In this case, use the latest PatientHeight entry to compute the BMI.</strike> </p>

<p>For every entry in PatientHeight, compute the BMI(Body Mass Index) with all the appropriate corresponding values in PatientWeight. </p>

<p>Some Logic:</p>

<ul>
<li>PatientHeight's EntryDate is &lt;= PatientWeight's EntryDate when pairing</li>
<li>PatientHeight has a one to many relationship with PatientWeight  </li>
<li>PatientHeight must take into account the EntryDate of the Previous PatientHeight and use it as a lower boundary when matching EntryDates in PatientWeight</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a function to compute BMI, it's just a question of how best to pair the data from the two tables.</p>

<p><em>Note: This must be done via a stored procedure, and I cannot change the tables</em></p>

<pre>
<b>PatientHeight</b>
PersonID
EntryDate
Inches

9783 | 01/01/2010 | 75in 
9783 | 01/01/2009 | 74in

</pre>

<pre>
<b>PatientWeight</b>
PersonID
EntryDate
Pounds

9783 | 01/01/2011 | 179lbs
9783 | 01/01/2010 | 175lbs
9783 | 12/01/2010 | 174lbs
9783 | 11/01/2010 | 178lbs
9783 | 01/01/2009 | 174lbs
9783 | 12/01/2009 | 174lbs
9783 | 11/01/2009 | 178lbs
</pre>

<p><strong>So</strong></p>

<p>Aside from iterating over every row in PatientWeight and querying for applicable Entries in PatientHeight and then computing BMI, is there any sort of fancy join to pair up the data correctly?</p>

<p>This would be ideal:</p>

<pre>
9783 | 01/01/2011 | 75in | 178lbs
9783 | 01/01/2010 | 75in | 175lbs
9783 | 12/01/2010 | 75in | 174lbs
9783 | 11/01/2010 | 75in | 178lbs
9783 | 01/01/2009 | 74in | 174lbs
9783 | 12/01/2009 | 74in | 174lbs
9783 | 11/01/2009 | 74in | 178lbs

"350250","Writing algorithm on 2D data set in plain english","<p>I have started an introductory Java class and the material is absolutely <em>horrendous</em> and I have to get excellent grades to be accepted into the master's degree, hence my very beginner question:</p>

<p>In my assignment I have to write algorithms (no pseudo-code yet) to solve a board game (Sudoku). Essentially, the notes say that an algorithm is specification of the input(s), the output(s) and the treatments applied to the input to get the output. My question lies on the wording of algorithms because I could probably code it but I can't seem to put it on paper in a coherent way.</p>

<p>The game has a 9x9 board and one of the algorithms to write has to find the solution by looking at 3 squares (either horizontal or vertical) and see if one of the three sub-squares match the number you are looking for. If none match then the number you are looking to place is in one of the other 2 set of 3 sub-squares (see image to get a better idea).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The task is not to write a complete solver. Only an algorithm to solve the particular case I have described.</p>

<p>I really can't get my head around how to formulate the solution into the terms described above or maybe it's just too simple, here's what I was thinking:</p>

<p><strong>Input:</strong> A 2-dimensional set of data of size 9 by 9 to be solved and a number to search for.</p>

<p><strong>Ouput:</strong> A 2-dimensional set of data of size 9 by 9 either solved or partially solved.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Scan each set of 3x9 and 9x3 squares. For each line or column of a 3x3 square check if the number matches a line (or column). If it does then move to the next line (or column). If not then proceed to the next 3x3 square in the same line (or column). Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Does that make sense as an algorithm written in plain english ? I'm not looking for an answer to the algorithm per se but rather on the formulation of algorithms in plain english.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LWV1I.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Apparently this isn't clear: this is not about solving for all possible solutions. This is about solving only this very particular set of rules. I did not make the assignment. In any case, this is not even remotely relevant as this is not the focus of my question.</p>

For displaying results in jasper report i am passing a HQL query as parameter. In query i am using ""union all"" clause </p>

<p>as below </p>

<p>In above query i am collecting some values from 3 POJO files which are HmsIpdGeneral, HmsIpdTransferDetail, HmsDischargeDetail  by creating subqueries to accomplish desired output.</p>

<p>this shows me result from the first part subquery only(which is written before ""union all"" clause). </p>

<p>Please suggest me alternative solution for ""union all"" clause which can be applied to combine results from two subqueries.</p>

<p>===== Editing =======</p>

<p>Here i am trying to make clear my scenario. Below are the 3 pojo file structure which i have. 
This application is for Hospital Management. i have to calculate the patient bed_charge and details for showing
which date to which date he was on which bed. If a patient gets admitted his BED_ID is enterd in HmsIpdGeneral table
and if he shifted to another bed then also values are enterd in HmsIpdGeneral table. </p>

<p>HmsIpdTransferDetail table keeps information about transfered patient and corresponding BED_ID.</p>

<p>HmsDischargeDetail table keeps information about discharged patient and corresponding vaccant BED_ID</p>

<p>I have to display the details of the patient that from which date to which date he was on which BED_ID and
have to show the BED_CHARGE.</p>

<p>Here is the POJO file structure (for convenience i have removed non-useful fields from the structure )</p>

<p>HmsIpdGeneral Table Structure  // Keeps information of BED_ID that on which date which bed is allotted to whom</p>

<pre><code> private Integer id;
 private String mrNumber;
 private String ipdId;    
 private String bedId;    // for BED_ID
 private double bedCharge;  // for BED_CHARGE
 private Date date;   // for FROM_DATE
</code></pre>

<p>HmsIpdTransferDetail Table Structure  // Keeps information of patient transfered to another BED_ID </p>

<pre><code> private Integer transferId;
 private String mrNumber;
 private String ipdId;
 private String fromWardCode;
 private String toWardCode; 
 private String fromBedNo;  // for BED_ID from where patient is transfered
 private String toBedNo;    // for NEW BED_ID where patient is transfered 
 private Date transferDate; // for TO_DATE
</code></pre>

<p>HmsDischargeDetail Table Structure // Keeps information of patient discharge and BED_ID status will become vaccant </p>

<pre><code> private String mrNumber;
 private String patientId; // ipdId will be inserted here    
 private String bedId; // for BED_ID where patient is last time shifted before discharge
 private Date dateAdmission;
 private Date dateDischarge;   // for TO_DATE
</code></pre>

"350270","Smart Centering and Scaling after Model Import in three.js","<p>Is there a way to determine the size and position of a model and then auto-center and scale the model so that it is positioned at the origin and within the view of the camera? I find that when I import a Collada model from Sketchup, if the model was not centered at the origin in Sketchup, then it is not centered in three.js. While that makes sense, it would be nice to auto-center to origin after importing. </p>

<p>I've seen some discussion in the different file loaders about getting the bounds of the imported model, but I have been unable to find any references to how to do that.</p>

<p>The scaling issue is less important, but I feel like it relates to a bounds function, which is why I asked it too.</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>More info after playing around a bit and a few more google searches...</p>

<p>The code for my callback function on loading the collada file now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>loader.load(mURL, function colladaReady( collada ) {

dae = collada.scene;
skin = collada.skins[ 0 ];

dae.scale.x = dae.scale.y = dae.scale.z = 1;
dae.updateMatrix();

//set arbitrary min and max for comparison              
var minX = 100000;
var minY = 100000;
var minZ = 100000;
var maxX = 0;
var maxY = 0;
var maxZ = 0;

var geometries = collada.dae.geometries;               
for(var propName in geometries){
if(geometries.hasOwnProperty(propName) &amp;&amp; geometries[propName].mesh){
    dae.geometry = geometries[propName].mesh.geometry3js;
    dae.geometry.computeBoundingBox();
    bBox = dae.geometry.boundingBox;
    if(bBox.min.x &lt; minX) minX = bBox.min.x;
    if(bBox.min.y &lt; minY) minY = bBox.min.x;
    if(bBox.min.z &lt; minZ) minZ = bBox.min.z;
    if(bBox.max.x &gt; maxX) maxX = bBox.max.x;
    if(bBox.max.y &gt; maxY) maxY = bBox.max.x;
    if(bBox.max.z &gt; maxZ) maxZ = bBox.max.z;
}
}
//rest of function....
</code></pre>

<p>This is generating some interesting data about the model. I can get an overall extreme coordinate for the model, which I'm assuming (probably incorrectly) would be close to an overall bounding box for the model. But trying to do anything with those coordinates (like averaging and moving the model to the averages) generates inconsistent results. </p>

<p>Also, it seems inefficient to have to loop through every geometry for a model, is there a better way? If not, can this logic be applied to other loaders?</p>

<p>I'm modifying the MapKit sample called tileMap to download tiles from a server and overlay that information on the map.  In the canDrawMapRect I call a function in the overlay class which in turn creates the url and opens up a connection.  I have already tested my connection class and have confirmed that it does indeed work.  I've run it in the init functions of overlay and overlayView with success.  The urls are good too since I can throw them in a browser and they show the right pngs.  I know that canDrawMapRect is running on multiple threads and I only have novice experience with threads.  </p>

<p>Pretty standards stuff.  If I run the code in the init of TileOverlayView it'll work just fine but if I run it in canDrawMapRect then none of the delegate functions get called.  I suppose it's also worth mentioning that the synchronous connection to the server does work in the canDrawMapRect method.  I don't get it at all T_T</p>

  &lt;item /&gt;
  &lt;item /&gt;

&lt;/Store&gt;

<p>Currently my solution to the problem is to ""hard code"" the root tag to an output stream, and marshal each of the repetitive element one by one:</p>

<pre><code>aOutputStream.write(""&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;"")
aOutputStream.write(""&lt;Store&gt;"")

foreach items as item
  aMarshaller.marshall(item, aOutputStream)
end

"350291","Improving help in R","<p>I always wander what other people say about the R help. Finally after some years of using, I decided that it is probably time to try to do something about it, because the feeling of gritting teeth does not go away with years of usage. :) Moreover, I think it is one of the few things where R does not kick asses to the other statistical softwares. So, to the point:</p>

<p>I get the feeling (by some experience with learning programming languages when I am not primarily a programmer but economist/statistician) that structure of help really helps and I would like to have it to go in the way</p>

<ul>
<li>basic syntax (by basic I really mean only the necessary arguments)</li>
<li>example for ""dummies"", to see what it does</li>
<li>click-here-if-you-want-to-know-more menu/button</li>
</ul>

<p>The best documentation that I ever used is probably one of Mathematica, look for example here -- ok, because I am new it prevents me from posting more than two links, so look for reference wolfram for Fit command (it is somehow related to the stuff below).</p>

<p>So what I did is that I took R help file for Fitting Linear Models ( <a href=""http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/lm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/lm.html</a> ) and put it into some more readable shape for me.
So I built some other version (actually two) look at <a href=""http://pinda.sifruje.cz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pinda.sifruje.cz/</a> . The ""original"" is just the same text taken and only some basic stuff solved (on my 27 inch monitor, if I make the browser full screen the original help is almost unreadable, because it stretches from one end to the other. Next we already have some pretty good fonts so why not to use them, here Linux Biolinum, and I did some to me aesthetic changes...). The ""custom"" goes a bit deeper and tries to implement a bit more of my thoughts. The buttons are really made quickly and only as an example. Also I do not claim that the code is anywhere good, I spent like hour or two just sawing some pieces that already lay around web. Just take it as some demonstration.</p>

<p>What I would like to receive from you is your opinions about this topic. The stuff that I did is pretty easy to do even algorithmically (some parser could probably parse the existing help files). The only added value here is making important stuff more visible. I also added the ""dummies"" example.</p>

<p>So please tell me what you think. I am a bit busy and if I do anything with it I would like to have it thought through carefully beforehand. Also if anybody would be interested in helping, or if he is running similar project, tell me.</p>

"350293","Java 2D game, game map and rectangle movement","<p><strong>The Game</strong></p>

<p>I have coded a simple Java game where there is a overhead view of a player on a 2D map that moves with the keyboard arrow input (up, down, left, right), my Play class that holds all of my game code is made up of a few methods, init which holds the initial game options things such as what way the player should be facing when the game starts, render which draws everything onto the screen such as the actual player and map, update which deals with the keyboard inputs and moving the player, when I say move the player, in this game it really is move the map, as the map is so big I needed the player to be able to walk around the map and the screen follow it and the simplest way of doing that was keeping the player still and moving the map creating the illusion that the player is actually moving.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>Everything works fine apart from the map, the map is a large 2D image, it has obstacles such as houses on it, at the moment the player just walks through the houses and other obstacles (lets concentrate on just the house for now), I need the game to stop the player from walking through the house. So I planned on using the simple rectangle collision detection and simply change the direction of the player if the collision occurred, so I tried making the two rectangles but a problem occurred, when I draw the rectangles on the screen using the render method (one above the player(rectOne), another above the house(rectTwo)) it doesn't exactly go to plan, when playing the game when I try move one rectangle the other follows it, this is a problem because how is there ever supposed to be a collision of the two rectangles move at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>The Code</strong></p>

<p>The code shown is a simplified version of the Play class that holds all of the game code:</p>

<pre><code>    imports are here
    public class Play extends BasicGameState{
    Animation bucky, movingUp, movingDown, movingLeft, movingRight;

    float shiftY = buckyPositionY + 160;//the numbers are half of the screen size
    java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D.Float rectOne = new Rectangle2D.Float(shiftX, shiftY,90,90);
    java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D.Float rectTwo = new Rectangle2D.Float(500 + buckyPositionX, 330 + buckyPositionY, 210, 150);

</code></pre>

<p>The code shows two rectangles (rectOne and rectTwo) rectOne is on top of the player and rectTwo should be on top of the house on the map, this does not happen, both recangles move together, remember, I mentioned that the map is moving and the player is staying still, the map is set to coordinates buckyPositionX and buckyPositionY and the player is set to shiftX and shiftY which is the centre of the screen, this can be replaced with constants if required as the player doesn't move, all if statements under the update method modify buckyPositionX and buckyPositonY that means that they move the map, so rectTwo (which is the house) also has to move whilst rectOne (the player rectangle) stays still, this is why I have used the variables buckyPositionX and buckyPoitionY for the rectTwo, but however my problem still occurs so there must be something wrong.</p>

<p>When i replace the highlighted line <code>AND element_id &lt;&gt; ALL (SELECT unit_id FROM units)</code></p>

<p>Which is basically the long way of specifying which values not to select, the query runs fine a produced the desired output, if i dont do it this way then i get the 'Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'ngc1' to data type int' error.</p>

<p>I would prefer not to manually code for each value as the list will grow over time and I will have to keep updating the query, which inevitably will be missed at some point causing more work than necessary.</p>

<p>Why does it do this? Even stanger depending on which unit i initially specify see sample line, it works for some and not others.</p>

"350317","rails: emulate ""Save page as"" behaviour","<p>for a rails project I need to provide the user with a downloadable HTML version of a statistics page. I got so far as creating a controller action that will set the header as follows and then render and return my vanilla html page:</p>

<pre><code>headers[""Content-Type""] ||= 'application/x-unknown'
headers[""Content-Disposition""] = ""attachment; filename=\""#{filename}\""""
</code></pre>

<p>This will make the browser pop open the download dialog instead of rendering the html right away, which is desired. However, this only gives me the blank HTML without any images or css embedded.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is essentially the same thing that the browser does when you click on the ""Save Page as"" menu item (probably even zip images, css and html file up in a zip file and return that).</p>

<p>What's the right way to do this? Is there a way to invoke the browser ""Save page as"" dialog with a header setting?</p>

"350319","Searching for partial match - 1 item to be searched in $n$ preprocessed items","<p>My problem is generalization of the simple problem:</p>

<p>Search for item $x$ in a set $S$.</p>

<p>This is trivial to do it fast if the elements are comparable. Sort the $S$, and do the binary search.  </p>

<p>My problem is that I'm interested in partial match. That is, my items are ordered sets of $n = 15$ numbers, and I consider them equal if they have $m = 10$ numbers (at same position) same. For smaller numbers (like 5 out of 6), I can use $n = 6$ sorted sets that have all $m = 5$ number subsets of preprocessed items and then just do 6 binary searches. But for large numbers $n$ and $m$ where $n - m &gt; 2$ number of sets (the binomial coefficient) explodes.</p>

<p>Is there efficient way to search for a partial match?</p>

<p>The only thing that I could think of is to index each number of the set. For example, when preprocessing size 3 sets:</p>

<pre><code>{1,2,3},//set0
{2,3,4}//set1
</code></pre>

<p>Create entries  </p>

<pre><code>1-&gt;(set0,pos0)(position is important), 2-&gt;(set0,pos1),(set1,pos0) ... (4-&gt;set1,pos2)
</code></pre>

<p>and then when I get a new number, I just go for the each number in it and check the sets in which it appears. If there is a set that has many hits (say 10 or more), they are declared the same.</p>

<p>Of course I could use an array trick (i.e. array[1234] contains the pointer to the list of sets that contain 1234). This works for small ranges. For large ranges, I could hash the number and do modulo.</p>

<p>Of course this could go very very wrong for some distributions of preprocessed data. </p>

<p>So is there a better way?</p>

<p>The rule is based on Col1 values, so it will switch back and forth when the value in Col1 is changed. So if the first value is A, the color will be, for example, yellow, and then when it changes to B, the cell color will be changed to green for all cells with Col1 = B. Then, change back again to yellow when the value changes again. Simply, it's just switching cell color back and forth for each distinct value in Col1, no matter what the values is.

"350341","Overriding mappings for a map of basic types","<p>I'm working on a JPA 2.0 compliancy kit for my internship... Part of that kit is testing corner cases.</p>

<p>JSR-317 states on Page 360 that ""The <code>AttributeOverride</code> annotation may be applied to an element collection containing instances of an embeddable class or to a <em>map collection whose key and/or value is an embeddable class.</em>""</p>

<p>How then, do I, according to JPA 2.0, override the mapping of a map of basic types? I know I can use @MapKeyColumn to map the key of the map, and I'm sure there is some way to map the value side of the @CollectionTable as well...</p>

<p>But how would I go about overriding these?</p>

<p>Consider an @Embeddable with a map</p>

<pre><code>@CollectionTable
@MapKeyColumn(name=""differentname_KEY"")
Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; testMap;
</code></pre>

<p>How would I go about overriding the key and the value? Do I use @AttributeOverride, or something else? (Or is it impossible?!)</p>

<p>I'm assuming here that such a map would be mapped with a @CollectionTable, so please correct me if I'm wrong.
If JPA doesn't give an answer, I'd be interested in knowing how persistence providers have solved this problem.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Viruzzo commented that basic types are embeddable types.
I'm willing to accept that, but something is holding me back:
JSR-317 is referring to an embeddable <em>class</em> (see upper quote). Type and class are not the same...</p>

"350346","How to enforce C89-style variable declarations in gcc?","<p>I work on a code base which is mostly C with a little C++, and is mostly built with gcc but occasionally it needs to be built with MSVC. Microsoft's C compiler is still pretty much C89 with a few minor extensions, and it still doesn't support mixed code and variable definitions <em>à la</em> C++/C99. So I need to find a way to prevent developers from writing out-of-order code/variable definitions while they are working with gcc, otherwise the build subsequently breaks with MSVC. If I use <code>gcc -std=c89</code> then everything breaks because C++-style comments are not allowed (there may be other issues too, but I haven't looked into this any further). If I use <code>gcc -std=gnu89</code> then the out-of-order code/variable definitions are allowed, so that doesn't help me either. Any ideas ? I guess I just need something like <code>gcc -std=c99 -fno-inline-variable-definitions</code>, if such an option existed.</p>

(I cannot modify the document itself and add a  directive)</p>

<p>So there are a couple of utility XML files like this:</p>

<p>wrapper.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE wrapper [
  &lt;!ENTITY content SYSTEM ""http://example.org/data.xml""&gt;
]&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet type=""text/xsl"" href=""unwrap.xsl"" ?&gt;
&lt;wrapper&gt;
  &amp;content;
&lt;/wrapper&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>unwrap.xsl:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0"" xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""&gt;
  &lt;xsl:import href=""stylesheet.xsl""/&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match=""/wrapper/node()[1]""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:apply-imports/&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So to summarize: stylesheet.xsl is written for <a href=""http://example.org/data.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.org/data.xml</a>, the browser is pointed to wrapper.xml and the user should see the transformed <a href=""http://example.org/data.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.org/data.xml</a>.</p>

<p>This is one of those rare cases where things work as expected in IE (and Chrome) but not Firefox.</p>

<p>AFAIK Firefox supports external XML entities, but it seems like they are invisible in XSL code. I found <a href=""http://lekkimworld.com/2006/05/29/firefox%5Fand%5Fexternal%5Fxml%5Fentity%5Freferences.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> from 2006, it describes this problem in Firefox 1.5 (I'm using 3.5.3)</p>

"350378","LINQ To SQL: Filtering a query across many tables","<p>I've inherited this project from the previous guy, and I'm presently in the process of switching over a number of assembled-from-string SQL queries into LINQ to SQL, which I'm told is what makes life in .NET worth living.  However, I'm running into problems filtering a Many-to-Many relationship.  </p>

<p>The system is a Project Management intranet affair.  The primary object/table of note is <em>Project</em>.  <em>Project</em> has many <em>Markets</em>, which uses an intermediary table <em>linkProjectMarkets</em> to link them.  There's plenty of other stuff going on, but I can take care of that if I can understand this problem, it's all similar.</p>

<p>In short, I can't for the life of me take a list of Market IDs provided by a set of checkboxes, and filter the list of projects down to those which have a relation to the markets whose ids are provided.</p>

<p>The gist of the schema is:</p>

<p><strong>Project</strong>: int id, ...(a bunch of metadata)<br>
<strong>linkProjectMarkets</strong>: int projectId, int marketId<br>
<strong>Market</strong>: int id, string summary</p>

<p>All of this, any many, many more, is defined in a dbml file and accompanying generated code. To facilitate access between <em>project</em> and <em>market</em>, <em>project</em> has the following addon method:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class project
{
    public EntitySet&lt;market&gt; markets
    {
        get
        {
            return (EntitySet&lt;market&gt;)from lpm in this._linkProjectMarkets
                                      select lpm.market;
        }
        set
        {
            var set = (EntitySet&lt;market&gt;)from lpm in this._linkProjectMarkets
                                         select lpm.market;
            set.Assign(value);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the most recent bit of code I'm attempting to use to filter the set of all projects:</p>

<pre><code>var projects = 
from p in db.projects
select p;

//MarketFilterList is an IEnumerable of market ids created from the checked checkboxes.
if(MarketFilterList.Count() &gt; 0){
    foreach (int mid in MarketFilterList){
        projects = projects.Where(p =&gt; p.markets.Select(m =&gt; m.id).Contains(mid));
        /*
        Causes ""Member access 'Int32 id' of 'PMIS2.market' not legal on type 
        'System.Data.Linq.EntitySet`1[PMIS2.market].""
        */
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>There are a number of other filters to apply, which is why I'm doing it in steps instead of one LINQ statement.</p>

<p>I checked out the designer code; market in linkProjectMarkets is public, and id is public in market.  It's my first real C#/.NET experience, so maybe I just don't understand the error message.  Apologies if I've given too much, not enough, or not the right information. Please help!</p>

<p>P.S. I already tried LINQ to Entities, and I would have to have a really good reason to try it again.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Here's something else I tried:</p>

<pre><code>projects = projects.Where(
    p =&gt; MarketFilterList.Intersect(from m in p.markets select m.id).Count() &gt; 0
);
</code></pre>

<p>That one told me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Local sequence cannot be used in LINQ to SQL implementation of query operators except the Contains() operator.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Edit again</h2>

<p>Here's the solution based on JTew's answer.  If anyone has the real reason why project can't access market directly I'd love to hear it.</p>

<pre><code>projects = projects.Where(p =&gt; (from lpm in db.linkProjectMarkets
                                where MarketFilterList.Contains(lpm.marketId)
                                select lpm.project).Contains(p));

When I look at the bottom pager it reports correctly ""View 1-50 of 117"" for the first page, ""View 51-100 of 117"" for the second, and so on.</p>

<p>If I perform a search (single search) returning, for example, 63 total records matching the filters, I expect to read at the bottom of the first page something like ""View 1-50 of 63"" (and in the jqGrid examples this is what happen). 
In my case, even if the records in the grid are 63 after the search operation, the bottom pager always shows ""View 1-50 of 117"", but obviously there are only 50 records in the first page and 13 in the second.</p>

<p>I looked at the documentation and examples, and it seems that what I'm trying to achieve would be the default behaviour... is it a bug? I'm using jqGrid 4.2.0</p>

I'm currently trying to get these controls to close after a certain period of inactivity but there doesn't seem to be a clearly documented method of doing this. So far I have managed to cobble the following solution together using a few suggestions both from this site and others.</p>

<pre><code>private Timer originalTimer = new Timer();

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.playcontrols);

    View exitButton = findViewById(R.id.controls_exit_pane);
    exitButton.setOnClickListener(this);
    View volUpButton = findViewById(R.id.controls_vol_up);
    volUpButton.setOnClickListener(this);
    View playButton = findViewById(R.id.controls_play);
    playButton.setOnClickListener(this);
    View volDownButton = findViewById(R.id.controls_vol_down);
    volDownButton.setOnClickListener(this);

    musicPlayback();

    originalTimer.schedule(closeWindow, 5*1000);    //Closes activity after 10 seconds of inactivity

}
</code></pre>

<p>And the code that should close the window</p>

<pre><code>//Closes activity after 10 seconds of inactivity
public void onUserInteraction(){
    closeWindow.cancel();   //not sure if this is required?
    originalTimer.cancel();
    originalTimer.schedule(closeWindow, 5*1000);
}

private TimerTask closeWindow = new TimerTask() {

    @Override
    public void run() {
        finish();
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>The above code makes perfect sense to me but it force closes upon any user interaction. It does however close normally if untouched and won't close after interaction if I remove the second schedule, so this seems to be the problem. Also note that I imagine I will be moving this timing task to another thread to help keep the UI snappy. I need to get it working first though :D.

<blockquote>
  <p>The pRoute parameter is NULL,
  SetIpForwardEntry is unable to read
  from the memory pointed to by pRoute,
  or one of the members of the
  MIB_IPFORWARDROW structure is invalid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know for certain that pRoute is not NULL and that no call to SetIpForwardEntry is involved, which leaves the only cause for the error as ""one of the members of the MIB_IPFORWARDROW structure is invalid.""</p>

<p>How do I know <strong><em>which</em></strong> of the members of MIB_IPFORWARDROW is invalid?</p>

<p>To further clarify my question: I know exactly what value each of these members has (I log them). At this point however, I can't tell which one is incorrect. They all look valid to me. It would be nice to know <strong>why</strong> one of the members is invalid. But for that I first need to know <strong>which</strong> of them is invalid.</p>

<p>For example, in one of the test cases (which produce the aforementioned error) I have:</p>

<pre><code>dwForwardDest = 199.239.136.200
dwForwardMask = 255.255.255.255
dwForwardPolicy = 0
dwForwardNextHop = 127.0.0.1

dwForwardMetric1 =  1
dwForwardMetric2 =  -1
dwForwardMetric3 = -1
dwForwardMetric4 = -1
dwForwardMetric5 = 0
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea why CreateIpForwardEntry() wouldn't agree to accept the above parameters?</p>

<p>Update: The tips provided below were very helpful but didn't really provide a <em>method</em> how to tell <em>which</em> member in MIB_IPFORWARDROW structure is invalid. I did correct the two members mentioned, but the problem persists:</p>

<pre><code>Dest = 199.239.136.200

<pre><code>ValueError: Data has no positive values, and therefore can not be log-scaled.

<p>but when I do it on the 'link' series I can draw the boxplot correctly.</p>

<p>I have verified that <strong>both</strong> the 'video' and 'link' series has NaN values and positive values.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on why this is occurring? Below is what I've done to verify that this is the case</p>

<p><strong>Below is sample code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>#get all the not null values of video to show that there are positive
temp=a.types_pivot[a.types_pivot['video'].notnull()]
print temp

#get a count of all the NaN values to show both 'video' and 'link' has NaN
count = 0 
for item in a.types_pivot['video']:
    if(item.is_integer() == False):
        count += 1

#try to draw the plots
print ""there is %s nan values in video"" % (count)

<pre><code>- (BOOL)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView shouldIndentWhileEditingRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath

<p>Now, on some of my cells I display the (+) plus sign by using the <code>editingStyleForRowAtIndexPath</code> method.</p>

<p>What I would also like to do is display various cell accessory types such as the detailDisclosureButton. I however cannot get this to work while the tableview is in editing mode. I think it only works when setEditing is set to NO.</p>

<p>Example, doing this on some tableViewCells does not make the button appear.</p>

<pre><code>cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCellAccessoryDetailDisclosureButton;

<p>However if I change the editing mode to NO, it works, but I loose the (+) signs from the editingStyleForRowAtIndexPath method...</p>

<p>How can I get both to work at the same time? Note, I never will have both a (+) sign and a accessoryButton on the same cell so if I could turn off editing at the cell level and not the tableview level that would solve the problem. Is this possible? Any other alternatives?</p>

"350423","How to switch database schema's?","<p>I'm working on a Delphi/WIN32 application that uses an SQL Server database as back-end, using ADO to access the data. There are many users who use this application, but one user is using a special setup: they have multiple database schema's and every schema contains the complete datamodel for the application. Every schema also has a database user which defaults to the specific schema. They also have a separate login account for every database user, allowing them to control which schema to use simply by using a different login account in the connection string.
They use this setup to have a single, centralized database which supports multiple offices. Normally, every office would have it's own database but here, every office has their own schema.</p>

<p>I like this solution that they're using. I haven't thought about this before simply because the application is normally used by single offices. Only this customer had a need to have a centralized database. The application works just fine, even though it's unaware of these schema's, simply because the login account will default to the correct schema.</p>

<p>But now they've asked if it's possible to change the code in a way that the user can select the schema to which they want to connect. Thus, a user needs to be able to switch between schema's in the application. And I don't want to rewrite the code to support these schema's simply because I need to keep the SQL code database neutral. So I'm looking for a way to switch a user to another schema without much impact on the code itself.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

"350436","Stack assignment to a thread","<p>I've been trying to piece together how stack memory is handed out to threads. I haven't been able to piece the whole thing together. I tried to go to the code, but I'm more confused, so I'm asking for your help. </p>

<p>I <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6659153/segmentation-fault-for-pthreads-in-a-recursive-call"">asked this question</a> a little while ago. So assume that particular program (therefore, all threads are within the same process). If I write <code>printf</code>s for each beginning of stack pointer, and then how much is allocated for them, then I get stuff like the table at the end of this message, where the first column is a <code>time_t usec</code>,  the second doesn't matter, the third is the tid of the thread, the fourth is the guard size, then begin of stack, end of stack (sorted by beginning of stack), last but one is the allocated stack (8 Megs by default) and the last column is the difference between the end of the first allocated stack, and the beginning of the next stack.</p>

<p>This means that (I think), if 0, then the stacks are contiguous, if positive, since the stack grows down in memory, then it means that there is ""free space"" of however many Mbs between a tid and the next (in memory). If negative, this means that memory is being reused. So this may mean that <em>that</em> stack space has been freed before this thread was created. </p>

<p>My problem is: what exactly is the algorithm that assigns stack space to threads (at a higher level than code) and why do I sometimes get contiguous stacks, and sometimes not, and sometimes get values like 7.94140625 and 0.0625 in the last column?</p>

<p>This is all Linux 2.6, C and pthreads.</p>

<p>This may be a question we will have to iterate on to get it right, and for this I apologize, but I'm telling you what I know right now. Feel free to ask for clarifications.</p>

<p>However in the context of a native app using webviews (a good example is facebook webview) the flow seems to be broken. Rather than opening a popup or new window it redirect the current webview to twitter page. From there there is no way for the user go back to the original page.</p>

<p>Is there any parameter that i could pass to  <a href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/intent/tweet</a> for twitter to redirect back to the user page after tweeting or canceling.
I have tried to use twitter @anywhere as well but the tweetbox does not even display on iOS UIWebview.</p>

<p>I guess the problem is that dash between words. I'd like to see SQL clause behind EntityFieldQuery, but i don't have entire drupal setup up when i'm running this, so modules like Devel are not loaded. And I don't have a clue how to inspect SQL otherwise.</p>

<p>I'm more than grateful of suggestions how to debug or how to solve this. Every link is appreciated.</p>

    -&gt;propertyCondition('name', $name) // $name = manufacturer, like ""Ferrari""

But when evaluating and playing around with Wix, I felt the declarative manner has some limitations compared to programmatic setup solutions. Moreover I found out, that the Wix documentation is rather sparse. So I came across Wix# (WixSharp) which promises to create Wix source code programmatically via script files written in C#.</p>

<p>However we've had some negative experiences with very small companies and even 'one-man-shows'. Therefore I just wanted to ask about your experiences with Wix# (WixSharp) or even other good alternatives out there. Can you report some advantages or limitations?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I applied this to my table but the borders are coming according to the size of content in each cell individually.
So sometimes i get double border...
I cannot apply height attribute here as data coming through tables so it is dynamic in size
I dont know how to remove those double borders from a cell and make all cell's size in a row equal.</p>

"350463","Doesn't JavaScript Minification hurt open source?","<p>There's an awful lot on the web these days about how important it is to minify your JavaScript. Speed is all that matters.</p>

<p>But doesn't minification work against the openness of Open Source?</p>

<p>One of the great things about JS (as opposed to flash and the back-end) is that the source code is right there, available to be viewed by other developers who come along and think ""Hey, that looks good, I wonder how they did that"". The JS source code is available for everyone to see, and so developers can learn from it, adapt it, and use similar JS on their own projects.</p>

<p>Minifying JS makes it unreadable. It stops the external developer from being able to read the code, and so cancels out horizontal sharing and learning.</p>

<p>Obviously there will be some who wish to minify their JS for the express purpose of attempting to hold on to their intellectual property. It's always a shame when people undermine the creativity of the open-source community, but it's somewhat understandable, and certainly not going to stop.</p>

<p>But for the rest of us developers - the people who use open-source every day of our lives - JS minification gets in our way. It makes us unable to take advantage of the openness of the web. It closes down the possibility of creative sharing.</p>

<p>I'm all about some things being minified - libraries, plugins, etc (and maybe when serving JS to mobile). But for the custom-built code that makes your individual website individual, minifying your code is really not that necessary. It may save a few ms of download time, but keeping it open won't change that much. Most of the sites on the web probably have less than 20KB of custom JS code, and the benefit of minifying that really is minimal. Do a few ms really compare with the benefit of keeping JS code open, readable and available for others?</p>

<p>For sites with more JS, maybe we could start to develop an open-source-based standard, so that developers can type in a slightly different URL in order to be served the unminified code. If the minified code is at domain.com/script.min.js, let's make the unminified always available at domain.com/script.js or /script.full.js. Or are there other suggestions?</p>

<p>I can't really find anything else on the web talking about this issue. Everything is on the other side - pushing minification. And that alarms me. It makes me think that, as developers, we've allowed ourselves to sink into an unquestioned ideology of speed, regardless of other factors. And probably, because of the nature of ideology, some of you reading this will immediately want to dismiss it and argue against it. But think just a little bit longer -  is the tiny speed benefit really worth the loss of open-source creativity? I don't believe it is.</p>

<p>So I guess my question is, where's the debate about open-source JavaScripting?</p>

<p>(the info I'm retrieving isn't sensitive but if the ssh implementation might have unpatched security flaws(if they haven't been updated for years) I'm worried about someone stealing my credentials.</p>

<p>Are there any other decent c# ssh libraries. If the command output is simple should I just run plink/putty(is it difficult to run a windows cmd shell for plink, and capture output(and is there a way to do it without the shell popping up)?</p>

<p>P.S. while the commercial library seems nice I prefer something free (as in cost and free in source if possible).</p>

<p>The Tabs should have all the advantages of Views - can be dragged to the desktop to become a detached view, be tiled near each other, rearranged etc.</p>

"350472","Updating datagrid from a thread with ObservableCollection databinding","<p>I'm new to WPF and MVVM and I started with <a href=""http://blog.lab49.com/archives/2650"" rel=""nofollow"">""Jason Dolinger on Model-View-ViewModel""</a> article and example but I have some questions regarding databinding.</p>

<p>1) In his demo application, he's subclassing DependencyObject for the ObservableCollection Items. What are the pros/cons compared to INotifyPropertyChanged ?</p>

<p>2) What is the best way to update the view from the model in a datagrid/listview ? In his example, he registers as a listener when a Quote object is added or updated :</p>

<pre><code>_source.QuoteArrived += new Action&lt;Quote&gt;(_source_QuoteArrived);
</code></pre>

<p>Than the ViewModel creates and adds the QuoteViewModel object to the collection OR updates the view by setting the updated Quote object in the convenient QuoteViewModel object using a dictionary called _quoteMap.</p>

<pre><code>void _source_QuoteArrived(Quote quote)
{

    QuoteViewModel qvm;
    if (_quoteMap.TryGetValue(quote.Symbol, out qvm))
    {
        qvm.Quote = quote;
    }
    else
    {
        qvm = new QuoteViewModel();
        qvm.Quote = quote;

        this.Quotes.Add(qvm);

        _quoteMap.Add(quote.Symbol, qvm);
    }
}   
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a better way to update the view from the model when a Quote object has been updated or am I forced to create a dictionnary ? It would be so easier if the listview could be updated immediately when a Quote object is updated... without having Quote to subclass INotifyPropertyChanged or DependencyObject.</p>

"350480","Why not Green Threads?","<p>Whilst I know questions on this have been covered already (e.g. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5713142/green-threads-vs-non-green-threads"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5713142/green-threads-vs-non-green-threads</a>), I don't feel like I've got a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>The question is: <em>why don't JVM's support green threads anymore?</em></p>

<p>It says this on the <a href=""http://www.codestyle.org/java/faq-Threads.shtml#greenthread"">code-style Java FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A green thread refers to a mode of operation for the Java Virtual
  Machine (JVM) in which all code is executed in a single operating
  system thread. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this over on <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/threads/threads.html"">java.sun.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The downside is that using green threads means system threads on Linux
  are not taken advantage of and so the Java virtual machine is not
  scalable when additional CPUs are added.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that the JVM could have a pool of system processes equal to the number of cores, and then run green threads on top of that.  This could offer some big advantages when you have a very large number of threads which block often (mostly because current JVM's cap the number of threads).</p>

"350481","Getting Outlook meeting request updates in MVC3","<p>Friends,</p>

<p>I have a question here.
I'm developing an VS2010 - MVC 3 Application with Razor engine for Human Resource Department of my office.</p>

<p>The objective is to automate the candidate hire process right from scheduling the interview till onboard.</p>

<p>Now comes the challenging part:</p>

<p>Interview will be scheduled and a meeting request will be sent to the panelists (All from the web application itself).  Now, I'm in a situation to find out who accepted the invite, so that it can become the integral part of my application to know whether he/she is available to take the interview.</p>

<p>It should find out the free time of the panelist and then send the invite accordingly.</p>

<p>Now my thoughts:</p>

<p>I thought to have microsoft outlook installed on the server itself.  We have a default sender (careers@xxxx.com) whose mailbox setup has already been made.  My application can have a web page to search for meeting requests sent and someone from HR can get the updates.  </p>

<p>But this involves some manual work.  I'm thinking to automate everything.</p>

"350486","Permanently Downcast c++ Pointer","<p>So this is probably a weird question, but I have a reasonably good reason for asking.</p>

<p>The gist of my question is, given an example with two levels of derivation on a class hierarchy:</p>

<p>Main Base Class:</p>

<pre><code>class Animal
{
  virtual void Draw() = 0;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Derived Class: </p>

<pre><code>class Dog : public Animal
{
  virtual void Draw()
  {
    // draw a generic dog icon or something...
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Further Derivation:</p>

<pre><code>class Corgi : public Dog
{
  virtual void Draw()
  {
    // draw a corgi icon...
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I'd love to be able to, from within the <code>Corgi</code> class, permanently downcast the 'this' pointer to a <code>Dog</code> pointer and then pass it off somewhere else as an Animal. This other place will then be able to call the <code>Draw</code> function and get the <code>Dog</code> method, not the virtual <code>Corgi</code> method. I know this is strange, but again, I have a vaguely legitimate reason for wanting to do it.</p>

<p>I've tried all the different casting operators and haven't had any luck, but maybe there is a consistent way of pulling this off? In the past I've caused myself trouble by not properly using <code>dynamic_cast</code> which resulted in a similar state for a pointer. Perhaps this time I can use that to my advantage?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Perhaps the above example doesn't illustrate clearly the what I'm trying to achieve, so I'll elaborate with my real goal.</p>

<p>I'm trying to achieve a shorthand for registering base class implementations that link into a scripting system I've been using for a while. The scripting system relies on a base class <code>IScriptContext</code> to facilitate access to real-code functions and member variable access. Internally base classes register their member function addresses and member variable addresses which are later dispatched/accessed through lookup tables. I'm in the process of adding proper support for class derivation hierarchies to the scripting system, and I figured being able to isolate the base class versions of these interfaces would help save time and make the whole process cleaner for me when it comes time to register available base classes with the script interpreter. There are other ways to achieve this, such as registering class specific function pointers for each required method for each available base class (e.g. <code>this-&gt;Dog::CallFunction</code>, <code>this-&gt;Dog::SetMember</code>, <code>this-&gt;Dog::GetMember</code>.) However, I figured using an interface would allow me to modify things a bit easier down the road if I ever needed to.</p>

<p>I hope all of that makes some kind of sense.</p>

There are two types of people who can do this: photographers and non-photographers. Photographers will tell you what's wrong and right in your photo from photography perspective, non-photographers will tell you stuff like ""wow amazing colors"" or ""this is so dark"" but they won't talk about shutter speed or aperture cause they probably don't know about these stuff.

The error was about using a method that is not available on current platform. It was <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Bundle.html#getString%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Bundle.getString(String, String)</a> method.</p>

<p>So I'd like to know if there're some tools that can check if an application uses API that is available on a minimal required platform.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I know that <code>Bundle.getString(String, String)</code> is from API Level 12 and I use API Level 7. I just want a tool that will automatically check for such kind of errors.</p>

"350501","Hosting multiple Wordpress sites on single server - best practices?","<p>I rent some webserver space (Linux, MySql, PHP, Apache) and host several Wordpress websites (for different clients, with different needs)
What would be the best way to Host multiple wordpress sites on a single machine, what I'm looking for here, is saving on diskspace and number of databases needed as well as simplifying maintenance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes this should be for a single wordpress version.</li>
<li>Each site should be able to have different plugins included and activated</li>
<li>Each site should be able to have it's own themes (some shared some not)</li>
<li>No crossing between sites - users and content not shared in any way.</li>
<li>Easily Upgradable</li>
<li>Single Super Admin is a plus but not essential
(I know how to install and manage wordpress, I can't figure out if Wordpress MU is what I need, if so how to set it up so that my requirements are met, can I enable/disable features per user/blog created with MU).</li>

<p>What I want to achieve is to record the sound by a stethoscope plugged in the phone while play sound through internal speaker.</p>

<p>Basically I use two ways to play sound, MediaPlayer and TextToSpeech.</p>

"350536","SQL Server Database In Single User Mode after Failover","<p>Here is a weird situation we experienced with a SQL Server 2008 Database Mirroring Failover.</p>

<p>We have a pair of mirrored databases running in high-availability mode and both the principal and mirror showed as synchronized. As part of some maintenance I triggered a manual failover of the principal to the mirror. However after the failover the principal was now in single-user mode instead of the expected ""Principal/Synchronized"" state we usually get. The database had been in multi-user mode on the previous principal before this had happened. We ended up stopping all applications, restarting the SQL Server instances, and executing ""ALTER DATABASE ... SET MULTI_USER"" to bring the database back to the expected ""Principal/Synchronized"" state in a multi-user mode.</p>

<p>Question.</p>

<p>Does anyone know where SQL Server stores information about whether a database should be in single-user mode or not? I'm wondering if there is some system database or table that has this setting recorded somewhere. In particular we had an incident once with the database on the original principal (the one I was failing over to) where when trying to detach the database it was put into single-user mode. I'm wondering if that setting is cached somewhere and is the reason that SQL Server put it back into single-user mode after a failover.</p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<p>If I select @safea as 162, then the number of unique values in lanes (5 and 4) but 5 has come up 4 times and 4 has come up as only 1 time so the final answer that I want is '5'.</p>

<p>Currently I am loading the data in a table and using jQuery tablesorter plugin, but obviously it takes way too long to just load the page and even longer to sort the columns.</p>

"350547","Parsing an XML string containing ""&#x20;"" (which must be preserved)","<p>I have code that is passed a <code>string</code> containing XML. This XML may contain one or more instances of <code>&amp;#x20;</code> (an entity reference for the blank space character). I have a requirement that these references should not be resolved (i.e. they should <em>not</em> be replaced with an actual space character).</p>

<p>Is there any way for me to achieve this?</p>

<p>Basically, given a string containing the XML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pattern value=""[A-Z0-9&amp;#x20;]"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I do <strong>not</strong> want it to be converted to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pattern value=""[A-Z0-9 ]"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(What I am actually trying to achieve is to simply take an XML string and write it to a ""pretty-printed"" file. This is having the side-effect of resolving occurrences of <code>&amp;#x20;</code> in the string to a single space character, which need to be preserved. The reason for this requirement is that the written XML document must conform to an externally-defined specification.)</p>

<p>I have tried creating a sub-class of <code>XmlTextReader</code> to read from the XML string and overriding the <code>ResolveEntity()</code> method, but this isn't called. I have also tried assigning a custom <code>XmlResolver</code>.</p>

<p>I have also tried, as suggested, to ""double encode"". Unfortunately, this has not had the desired effect, as the <code>&amp;amp;</code> is <em>not</em> decoded by the parser. Here is the code I used:</p>

<pre><code>string schemaText = @""...&lt;pattern value=""""[A-Z0-9&amp;#x26;#x20;]"""" /&gt;..."";
XmlWriterSettings writerSettings = new XmlWriterSettings();
writerSettings.Indent = true;
writerSettings.NewLineChars = Environment.NewLine;
writerSettings.Encoding = Encoding.Unicode;
writerSettings.CloseOutput = true;
writerSettings.OmitXmlDeclaration = false;
writerSettings.IndentChars = ""\t"";

StringBuilder writtenSchema = new StringBuilder();
using ( StringReader sr = new StringReader( schemaText ) )
using ( XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create( sr ) )
using ( TextWriter tr = new StringWriter( writtenSchema ) )
using ( XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.Create( tr, writerSettings ) )
{
   XPathDocument doc = new XPathDocument( reader );
   XPathNavigator nav = doc.CreateNavigator();

   nav.WriteSubtree( writer );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The written XML ends up with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pattern value=""[A-Z0-9&amp;amp;#x20;]"" /&gt;

Now, this is done so that the receiver would recompute the checksum with the data and the checksum and if the result were all ones, it can be certain (well, almost!) that there's no error. My question is why would we have to do a final complement of the result at the sender. We might as well send it as such so that when the receiver recomputes the checksum, it'll have to check for all zeros, instead of all ones like in the other case.</p>

"350556","Changing View properties after onCreate()","<p>First time poster, new to Android, and I seem to have hit a roadblock on this problem:</p>

<p>I'm creating a dynamic layout, consisting of several identical ""composite"" objects (these are basically ""floating"" LinearLayouts, each containing an icon (ImageView) and a caption (TextView)).  The (x,y) coordinates of each LinearLayout are subject to change, based on user actions, and require precise placement (ie: can't use RelativeLayout, etc), so I'm positioning them inside an AbsoluteLayout.</p>

<p>During onCreate(), I'm adding each of these objects as a child View inside an AbsoluteLayout object, then setting the (x,y) manually.  No problems so far, works great, initial layout is perfect.</p>

<p>The problem:</p>

<p>After the initial onCreate(), I can't get the (x,y) positions of these objects to change on the screen.  I can update their layoutParams, but the on-screen layout (inside the AbsoluteLayout) is never refreshed.  I've tried forceLayout(), invalidate(), requestLayout(), none of them work.</p>

<p>Is there a problem with my basic approach here, or is there something I'm just missing?</p>

<p>I'm thinking of changing to a SurfaceView and just doing the rendering the hard way, but my code works 99% great right now and I don't want to change it if I don't have to.  The only problem is that the layout manager simply refuses to register the position changes for my child objects.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/thats-not-a-memory-leak-its-bloat/"" rel=""nofollow"">Some reading</a> told me that ActiveRecord apparently does not hand back memory to the OS after a request. Looking <code>UsersController#index</code>, I can see how this might cause a problem if the memory allocated by <code>User.order</code> was not freed.</p>

<p><code>UserController#index:</code></p>

<pre><code>require 'will_paginate/array'

class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController
  PER_PAGE = 20

  def index
    @users = Rails.cache.read(""users"")
    if @users.nil?
      # .all is used to force the query to happen now, so that the result set is cached instead of the query
      @users = User.order(""views DESC"").all
      Rails.cache.write(""users"", @users)
    end

    @users = @users.paginate(page: params[:page], per_page: PER_PAGE)

    if params[:page].nil? || params[:page] == ""1""
      @rank = 1
    else
      @title = ""Page #{params[:page]}""
      @rank = (params[:page].to_i - 1) * PER_PAGE + 1
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>index.html.erb</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;% @users.each do |user| %&gt;
  image_tag user.profile_picture, alt: user.name
  &lt;h3&gt;&lt;%= @rank %&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= user.name %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= user.views %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;% @rank += 1 %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;%= will_paginate %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know how I'm supposed to get around this though. I thought of possibly only pulling up one page of users into memory at a time, but with only 9 users, that wouldn't really change anything since a max of 20 is supposed to be listed per page. Do I have to manually clear <code>@users</code> from memory after every request, or is my approach in <code>UsersController#index</code> just wrong?</p>

"350571","Problems sending SOAP auth Headers in php","<p>I am very new to SOAP (i.e. no clue!)</p>

<p>I have been asked by a client to interact with an existing SOAP service that requires authentication done through my SOAP headers ( a simple username and password ) </p>

<p>I have 3 methods at my disposal,</p>

<p>IsAlive
IsAliveSecure
ChangeUserDetails</p>

<p>IsAlive simply returns true and I can call it no problem</p>

<p>IsAliveSecure returns true with proper authorisation and I cannot get it to return true.</p>

<p>basically I need to send the following request:</p>

<pre><code>POST /ripplecomprovisioning.asmx HTTP/1.1
Host: provisioning.example.ie
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: length
SOAPAction: ""http://www.blueface.ie/provisioning/IsAliveSecure""

    &lt;IsAliveSecure xmlns=""http://www.example.ie/provisioning/"" /&gt;
  &lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My question is how do I send a request formatted like the above in php?</p>

<p>this is what I tried but with no success:</p>

<p>$soapClient = new SoapClient(""https://provisioning.example.ie/ripplecomprovisioning.asmx?WSDL""); </p>

<pre><code>// Prepare SoapHeader parameters 
$sh_param = array( 
            'Username'    =&gt;    'myusername', 
            'Password'    =&gt;    'mypassword'); 
$headers = new SoapHeader('ripplecomprovisioning', 'SoapAuthHeaders', $sh_param); 

// Prepare Soap Client 
$soapClient-&gt;__setSoapHeaders(array($headers)); 
     $result = $soapClient-&gt;isAlive();

echo var_dump($result);

echo ""&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"";

   $result = $soapClient-&gt;IsAliveSecure();

echo var_dump($result);
</code></pre>

<p>the output from the above is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>object(stdClass)#3 (1) {

  bool(true)
}

<p>I was wondering, is it possible for me to convert this data into a MySQL database without manually specifying the XPath stuff?</p>

<p>For example, is it possible for a Java or Python or whatever program to analyse the XML structure, based on the XSD, extract the table columns, and populate it with data?</p>

<p>I tried using PHPMyAdmin to import my XML file, but it didn't work and said there was a problem, which I think was related to the fact that it couldn't create the columns. As far as I know, it can handle CSV files better, so that's another option for a 2 stage conversion.</p>

<p>The forward image of the domain mapped by the gradient is the domain of the Legendre conjugate so I think the above is true. If you could point me to a proof that will be very helpful.</p>

<p>I can see that the Legendre conjugate is convex because it is a supremum of affine functions, but am looking for a more direct intuition / construction for the forward image of the domain mapped by the gradient. What is bothering me is what happens when the supremum that is used to define the conjugate is not achieved. The value of the conjugate is set to $\infty$ but is there a way to show that the set over which the supremum is achieved is convex (even if $f$ is unbounded below).</p>

"350578","What is the most appropriate form to write this code","<p>I am writing a set of classes using the Vaadin framework for reports and I was wondering what the most appropriate form was to structure a report class heirarchy. Important information is as follows:</p>

<p>A report consists of an outer 'shell' or window which has a series of ""Export to..."" buttons, a ""Generate Report"" button and a ""Back"" button. </p>

<p>The report itself exists as a nested/inner element. </p>

<p>Taking this into regard I wrote an abstract Report.java class representing the outer elements which remain invariant. A new report subclasses it and defines the necessary behaviour to generate the inner report. The problem, however, is the export feature. The export feature exist as a general visual element, but by default, no behaviour is defined as each report has different data and structure. Thus, I need to be able to change this behaviour in the subclass. What would be the most appropriate form to permit subclasses to alter the export buttons listener behaviour (in terms of appropriate, performance or 'elegance' would be the criterias)? </p>

<p>Sorry the indentation is a little weird, tried messing with the code blocks but couldn't get it quite perfect. However, I am wondering why it shows the correct thing during the while loop as it goes along, but then after it is complete the for loop shows all three of the array entries having the same name(the value is correct for the third entry but for the first and second entries the value field contains half of the correct value for the third entry)</p>

For example, 35 will be displayed as #. But this is not what I want. Of course, CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL((int)a, (int)b) may be a solution but it looks like strange.

<li><p></p></li>
<li><p>I am not really sure how to do this one. Firstly, I know that a linear operator is continuous iff it is bounded, so I need to show that a linear operator $T: V \to V$ is bounded if the unit sphere $\{x \in V : ||x|| = 1\}$ is compact. I have been told to assume that $T$ is unbounded and try to get a contradiction. If T is unbounded then $||T|| = \sup_{||x|| = 1}\{||Tx||\} = \infty$. I don't know what to do from here.</p></li>

<p>I have this application that runs a couple of HTML pages in a WebView. Everything looks nice and works OK, until you try to open a SELECT tag - boom, application crashes.
Here's a trace stack, if this helps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thread [&lt;1> main] (Suspended (exception WindowManager$BadTokenException)) 
      AlertDialog(Dialog).show() line: 247<br>
      WebView$InvokeListBox.run() line: 7841<br>
      WebView$PrivateHandler(Handler).handleCallback(Message) line: 587<br>

      ZygoteInit.main(String[]) line: 598 
      NativeStart.main(String[]) line: not available [native method]  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(What does AlertDialog have to do with opening a select box is beyond me. And no, there's no script associated with the SELECT that opens an Alert).</p>

<p>Now, here's the best part. I'm testing the app on 2 devices, Samsung Galaxy S2 with OS 2.3.3, and Motorola RAZR XT910 with OS 2.3.5. On Samsung everything works wonderful. On RAZR, however, the above happens.</p>

<p>The pages are pretty heavy with CSS and JavaScript, but it's crashing even if everything is removed. In fact, an empty HTML with a single SELECT control still crashes.
A few things mentioned in the question from year ago that I did try:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removing all absolute and fixed positioned elements from the HTML (in fact I removed the entire CSS just to see if it has any effect - it doesn't).</li>
<li>Ensuring the SELECT is written by-the-book, no bogus attributes / tags.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing helped.</p>

<p>Does anyone have the slightest clue as to what might be causing this?</p>

<p>I have looked for many, many days for this!</p>

<p>My question is what is the best way to play a .wav sound file? Source would be VERY helpful! I dont need any fancy mixing or whatever. Just a play and maybe a stop function. Note- This is an application, not an applet.</p>

<p>The thing that worked best for me is the Clip way, because of the small code size and understandability. However, every time I use clip.open(), a error occurs. </p>

<pre><code>IllegalStateException: Mixer is already open
</code></pre>

<p>and the relevant code-</p>

<pre><code>String stringFile = ""example.wav"";
File soundFile = new File(stringFile);
AudioInputStream inputStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(soundFile);
AudioFormat format = inputStream.getFormat();
DataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(Clip.class, format);
clip = (Clip) AudioSystem.getLine(info);
clip.open(inputStream);
clip.start();
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>And another related question- Im pretty new to using multiple classes, so would it be possible to- Have another class for playing sound, and in the constructor of that class pass in the file name. Then could you play the sound file inside the constructor method?</p>

I want to know the real technical differences between them. Is there any one here who can tell me the difference or share some documentation source?</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

"350627","Hadoop: List of all settings that can be set by client using Configuration class?","<p>In Hadoop client API there is important class <a href=""http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/conf/Configuration.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Configuration</code></a> that stores properties for connection to cluster, job to be sent, HDFS. These are just key-value pairs and both key and values are <code>String</code>s. There are not list of all meaningful keys that can by used to change map-reduce job settings? That is I need list of all keys that can by used to set properties of <code>Configuration</code> that would be later interpreted by client API, namenode or jobtracker.</p>

"350628","How can my vhdl code and microblaze co-exist?","<p>Well my problem stated when i had my vhdl code up and running on my Spartan-3a but needed to send and receive data from it to the pc,
I need my vhdl code , so i went for a microplaze structure , problem is I cant understand how will my vhdl code and microblaze co-exist at the same time because every time i program fpga with SDK it deletes my vhdl off the fpga and vise versa with ISE, I dont want to use custom peripherals except if this is the only solution.
Some people just tell me to just use microblaze hdl files produced by EDK, OK but theny aren't I using an unprogrrammed MicroBlaze???
And do i need to go through all of this just to be able to communicate with my vhdl code through pc(NO I CANT USE R232 since i need a speed of 56Mbit/sec)</p>

<p>So here is what i don't understand:
1-IF you implemented microblaze through hardware(HDL from edk to ISE) , isnt it then an un-proggrammed processor?</p>

<p>2-PEOPLE TELL ME i can let microblaze and my vhdl code see each other through GPIO , again how will i implement GPIO and how to connect it to both microblaze and my vhdl code , and how to program microblaze while it in hardware in this situation.</p>

<p>Please any help , its kinda a mess.</p>

"350629","RCP extensions from several plugin's","<p>I have RCP, and 2 products, based on fetures. I have my.project.gui plugin, that have some gui-extensios, like views, perspectives, prefetencePages. etc.. </p>

<p>First product have some gui (feature of this product includes my.project.gui). And I want to my second product to have some extended gui. I created plugin, named my.project.gui.extended and added it to my second project feature. Then added some gui-excensions to my.project.gui.extended. But this doest work! I lauch my second product and see only my.project.gui-extensions, and dont see my.project.gui.extended-extensions.</p>

<p>Tried to add my.project.gui.extended to all dependences, but this didnt solve problem.</p>

<p>Is there any things i need to do to make this work? Or I need to this job in some other way?</p>

<p>===================================</p>

<p>Added information:</p>

<pre><code>1st product feature has:
my.product.main1 (plugin with 1st product, application class, etc... has gui in dependences),
my.product.gui,
my.product.shared,
my.product.others1

2nd product feature has:
my.product.main2 (plugin with 2nd product, application class, etc... has gui and gui.extended in dependences),
my.product.gui,
my.product.gui.extended,
my.product.shared,
my.product.others2
</code></pre>

<p>type of extention is org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages (2nd product has server preference page, but 1st doesn't)</p>

<p>i think this is not runtime problem. </p>

"350630","Access Element inside Silverlight DataTemplate","<p>I have not been able to find a clean solution to the following problem even though there are a few related questions already on SO.</p>

<p>If I have a data template that is being used multiple times, for example, a TreeViewItem.HeaderTemplate, how can I change something the template for only some of the TreeViewItems.</p>

<p>For example, let's say my TVI HeaderTemplate has a textblock and depending on the string, I want to make the fontweight bold.</p>

<p>I want to do something like this: </p>

<pre><code>((TextBlock)myTreeView.Items.ElementAt(0).FindName(""myTextBlock"")).FontWeight = FontWeights.Bold;
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have a solution for this? --> Thanks Evan</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Is there a way to write a generic function to get a control based on it's name even if it's in a data template?</p>

<p><code>LayoutRoot.FindName(""myTextBlock"");</code> would work if myTextBlock was not in a datatemplate. How can I write a <code>findElementInDataTemplate(string elementName, string parentName)</code> function? </p>

<p>The reason Evan's answer is not what I'm looking for is because I am developing a control. I want the application developer who uses my control to be able to change any element in the control. If I use Evan's solution, that would require the application developer to have access to all the templates in the control. Possible, but not ideal. Thanks!</p>
